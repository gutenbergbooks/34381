<h2><a name="introduction" id="introduction"></a><i>Introduction.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dcapt"><span class="dcap">T</span></span>HE following biographical sketches were
originally published in America by Mr.
George T. Ferris, in two volumes, separately
entitled <i>The Great German Composers</i> and
<i>The Great Italian and French Composers</i>.
They have achieved the success they deserved:
for while we have whole libraries of books upon the
history and technicalities of music in general, upon musical
theories and schools, and upon the exponents thereof in their
artistic capacity, there has been a distinct dearth of treatises
dealing in a brief and popular fashion with the lives of eminent
composers themselves. Now, when music is &ldquo;mastered and
murdered&rdquo; in almost every house throughout the length and
breadth of the land, there can be no doubt that compilations of
this kind must be welcome to a very large number&mdash;we will not
say of musical students, but of lovers of music. There are, it
would be needless to attempt to prove, great numbers of the
music-loving public, who practically have no facilities towards
making acquaintance with the leading facts in the lives of those
men whose compositions they have such a genuine delight in
rendering: to these mainly is such a book as <i>Great Composers</i>
addressed. But, indeed, to every one interested in music
and musicians the volume can hardly fail to be of interest. In
his preface to <i>The Great Italian and French Composers</i>, Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>viii]</a></span>
Ferris explained that&mdash;as was very manifest&mdash;&ldquo;the task of
compressing into one small volume suitable sketches of the
more famous Italian and French composers was, in view of the
extent of field and the wealth of material, a somewhat embarrassing
one, especially as the purpose was to make the sketches of
interest to the general music-loving public, and not merely to
the critic and scholar. The plan pursued has been to devote
the bulk of space to composers of the higher rank, and to pass
over those less known with such brief mention as sufficed to
outline their lives, and fix their place in the history of music.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To <i>The Great German Composers</i> he prefaces a few words
which may be quoted&mdash;&ldquo;The sketches of composers contained
in this volume may seem arbitrary in the space allotted to them.
The special attention given to certain names has been prompted
as much by their association with great art epochs, as by the
consideration of their absolute rank as composers. The introduction
of Chopin, born a Pole, and for a large part of his life a
resident of France, among German composers, may require an
explanatory word. Chopin&rsquo;s whole early training was in the
German school, and he may be looked on as one of the founders
of the latest school of pianoforte composition, whose highest
development is in contemporary Germany. He represents
German music by his affinities and his influences in art, and
bears too close a relation to important changes in musical forms
to be omitted from this series.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Various important events have occurred since the publication
of these volumes in America: <i>inter alia</i>, the performance of
Wagner&rsquo;s last great work &ldquo;Parsifal,&rdquo; and the death of the great
German musician; the production of new works by Gounod and
Verdi; and so forth. The editor has endeavoured, as briefly as
practicable, to supplement Mr. Ferris&rsquo;s <i>causeries</i> with the
addenda necessary to bring <i>Great Composers</i> down to date.
Mr. Ferris further acknowledges his obligation to the following
authorities for the facts embodied in these sketches:&mdash;Hullah&rsquo;s
<i>History of Modern Music</i>; F&eacute;tis&rsquo; <i>Biographie Universelle des
Musiciens</i>; Clementi&rsquo;s <i>Biographie des Musiciens</i>; Hogarth&rsquo;s
<i>History of the Opera</i>; Sutherland Edwards&rsquo; <i>History of the
Opera</i>; Schl&uuml;ter&rsquo;s <i>History of Music</i>; Chorley&rsquo;s <i>Thirty Years&rsquo;
Musical Reminiscences</i>; Stendhall&rsquo;s <i>Vie de Rossini</i>; Bellasy&rsquo;s
<i>Memorials of Cherubini</i>; Grove&rsquo;s <i>Musical Dictionary</i>;
Crowestl&rsquo;s <i>Musical Anecdotes</i>; Sch&oelig;lcher&rsquo;s <i>Life of Handel</i>;
Liszt&rsquo;s <i>Life of Chopin</i>; Elsie Polko&rsquo;s <i>Reminiscences</i>; Lampadius&rsquo;
<i>Life of Mendelssohn</i>; Urbino&rsquo;s <i>Musical Composers</i>; Franz
Hueffer&rsquo;s <i>Wagner and the Music of the Future</i>; Haweis&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>ix]</a></span>
<i>Music and Morals</i>; and the various articles in the leading
cyclop&aelig;dias.</p>

<p>To this volume the present editor has appended a chronological
table of the musicians referred to in the following sketches.</p>

<p>In reading the lives of these great musical composers, we
can trace the gradual development of music from its earliest
days as an art and as a science. Unlike the other arts which
have flourished, decayed, and had rebirth, music, as we now
understand it, sprang into being out of the ferment of the
Renaissance, and therefore is the youngest of the arts&mdash;a
modern growth belonging particularly to the later phases of
civilisation. Music in a rude, undeveloped condition has existed
doubtless &ldquo;since the world began.&rdquo; In all nations, and
in the records of past civilisations, indications of music are to be
found; martial strains for the encouragement of warriors on the
march; sacred hymns and sacrificial chants in religious ceremonials;
and song accompanied by some rude instrument&mdash;we
find to have been known and practised among remote tribes as
well as among potent races. The bards of divers peoples and
many countries in ancient days played upon the harp not
merely for delight, but for the exorcism of evil spirits, the dispersion
of melancholy, the soothing and cure of mental and
physical disorders. Here we find music as the direct expression
of feeling, but not as a science. The Greeks made further use
of music by incorporating it into their dramas, but it was chiefly
declamatory, and was used solely in the choruses. To modern
ears such music would sound very inefficient, more especially
as the antique instruments were of the crudest&mdash;and although
musical sounds, to a limited extent, could be produced from
them, all attempts at <em>expression</em> must have been unsuccessful.</p>

<p>In Europe in the early middle ages there existed two kinds of
music: that of the people, spontaneous, impulsive, the song of
the Troubadour, unwritten and orally transmitted from father to
son; that of the Church, which had been greatly encouraged
since the days of Constantine, and especially owed much to St.
Ambrose and St. Gregory. For a time music became the
handmaid of the Church, but it thereby, to a certain extent, also
gave voice to the lyrical feelings of the people; for the chorister
and composer not only embodied popular songs into the chants,
but in many instances interpolated the words themselves. This
incongruity at length necessitated the reform, brought about
by Palestrina&mdash;the father of sacred music as we now know it&mdash;whose
<i>Missa Papae Marcelli</i>, performed in 1565, established
a type which has been more or less adhered to ever since. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>x]</a></span>
services of the Church gave rise to the oratorio, which, however,
chiefly owes its development to Protestant genius, more
especially to Handel. In 1540 San Filippo Neri formed in
Milan a Society called &ldquo;Le congregazione dei Padri dell&rsquo;
Oratorio&rdquo; (from <i>orare</i> to pray), and we are told by Crescembini
that &ldquo;The oratorio, a poetical composition, formerly a commixture
of the dramatic and narrative styles, but now entirely
a musical drama, had its origin from San Filippo Neri, who in
his chapel, after sermons and other devotions, in order to allure
young people to pious offices, and to detain them from earthly
pleasures, had hymns, psalms, and such like prayers sung by
one or more voices.&rdquo; &ldquo;Among these spiritual songs were dialogues;
and these entertainments, becoming more frequent and
improving every year, were the occasion that, in the seventeenth
century, oratorios were invented, so called from their origin.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>Then came the fulness of the Renaissance, quickening dead
forms into new life, laying its vivifying touch on the new-born
art, music, and making it its nursling. At first the change was
hardly perceptible. It was church music out of church, fine,
stately, what may with seeming paradox be called statuesque,
which came to bear the name of <i>L&rsquo;Opera</i>, signifying <i>The
Work</i>:&mdash;but, though born to a heritage of good aims,
possessed of very inadequate means for their fulfilment.
Once liberated from its presumed function of expressing
religious feeling, and thus subjected to other impelling forces,
music could not long remain in the old forms. It began to feel
its way into new channels, and in the form of the opera became
a national institution. Its growth at first was weak and faulty;
but finally it developed into a perfect art. It was as the
novice, who, freed from the sanctity of the convent with its calm
lights and shadows, enters at last the portals of the life of the
world&mdash;a varied world full of turmoil, passion, and strife. A
greater world, after all, than that quitted, because composed
of so many possibilities in so many directions, and comprising
the sufferings, the joys, the aspirations of such innumerably
differentiated beings; a world wherein the novice learns to
widen her sympathies, to feel with and for the people, and
to express for them the never-ceasing craving for something
beyond the fleeting moment. At first, therefore, the stately
art and the musical needs of the people were dissimilar and
apart; but little by little each gave to and took from the
other, till at length, out of the marriage of these elementaries, a
third arose to become the expression of the life of the people,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xi]</a></span>
partaking in likeness of both, having lost certain qualities, having
gained many more, becoming richer, broader, more eclectic&mdash;in
short, developing into the more fitting expression of the manifold
aspirations of modern days, when life is varied and intense,
and the mind gropes blindly in every direction.</p>

<p>This development is traceable in all art, and in the sphere of
music it is most manifest in the opera. Like all great movements
the opera began humbly. Towards the end of the sixteenth
century a number of amateurs in Florence, dissatisfied
with the polyphonic school of music, combined &ldquo;to revive
the musical declamation of the Greeks,&rdquo; to wed poetry and
music&mdash;so long dissevered&mdash;to make the music follow the
inflexion of the voice and the sense of the words. The
first opera was &ldquo;Il Conte Ugolino,&rdquo; composed by Vicenzio
Galileo&mdash;father of the famous astronomer&mdash;and it was followed
by various others, the titles of which need not here be recorded.
At first, such performances took place in the palaces of nobles
on grand occasions, when frequently both performers and
musicians were of high rank. At length, however, in 1637 a
famous theorbo player, Benedetto Farrari, and Francesco
Manetti, the composer, opened in Venice an opera-house at
their own risk, and a little later brought out with great success
&ldquo;Le nozzi di Peleo e di Telide&rdquo; by Cavalli, a disciple of
Monteverde, and it was henceforth that the opera became, as
we have said, a national institution. Schools for singing were
opened in Rome, Naples, and Venice&mdash;the science of music made
rapid strides&mdash;instruments for orchestral purposes naturally
likewise improved in quality and in variety; and the opera
developed continuously in breadth of treatment and form in the
hands of Scarlatti, Leo, Jommelli, and Cimarosa.</p>

<p>About the beginning of the eighteenth century a rival to the
<em>serious</em> opera sprang up in Naples&mdash;the <em>comic</em> opera, the direct
offspring of the people, and of lower artistic standing. But as
the serious opera became more stately, more scientific, more
purely formal, less human, less the expression of direct feeling,
cultivated more for art&rsquo;s sake solely, the comic opera throve on
the very qualities that its elder sister rejected, till at length the
greatest musicians of the day, Pergolesi, Cimarosa, Mozart,
wrote their masterpieces for it. Ultimately the two were fused
into one, that is, into the modern Italian opera. The comic opera,
as we now understand it, is of French origin.</p>

<p>From Italy the opera found its way into other countries with
varying results. In England it took early root, and assimilated
itself with the earlier <i>masques</i> which were played at Whitehall and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xii]</a></span>
at Inns of Court. In the early productions in this country, however,
the music was merely incidental. During the Commonwealth,
an opera entitled &ldquo;The Siege of Rhodes,&rdquo; composed by
Dr. Charles Colman, Captain Henry Cook, Henry Lawes, and
George Hudson, was performed in 1655, under the express
license of Cromwell. Purcell seems, however, to have been the
first to see the possibility of a national English opera;&mdash;his music
to Dryden&rsquo;s &ldquo;King Arthur,&rdquo; and to the &ldquo;Indian Queen,&rdquo; is considered
very beautiful; &ldquo;his recitative was as rhetorically perfect
as Lulli&rsquo;s, but infinitely more natural, and frequently impassioned
to the last degree; his airs are not in the Italian form,
but breathe rather the spirit of unfettered natural melody, and
stand forth as models of refinement and freedom.&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Beggar&rsquo;s Opera,&rdquo; set to music by Dr. Pepusch, and Dr. Arne&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Artaxerxes,&rdquo; a translation from Metastasia&rsquo;s libretto, adapted to
melodious music, were deservedly popular, and long retained a
place on the stage. Nevertheless, when the Italian opera became
an institution in England, the national opera made no further progress.
During the last few years the former seems to have practically
died out in England, and it remains to be seen in what form
the English opera will revive and flourish once more as a national
product. We have good promise in the works of such musicians
as Balfe, Wallace, Sterndale Bennet, Sir G.&nbsp;A. Macfarren, Dr.
A.&nbsp;C. Mackenzie, Sir Arthur Sullivan, Mr. C.&nbsp;V. Stanford, and
others.</p>

<p>The end of the sixteenth and end of the seventeenth centuries
form what has been called &ldquo;the golden age of English music&mdash;aye
for all musical Europe&mdash;of the madrigal. Nowhere was
the cultivation of that noble form of pure vocal music, whether
in composition or in performance, followed with more zeal or
success than in England.&rdquo; The Hon. Roger North, Attorney-General
to James II., in his <i>Memories of Musick</i>, speaks
thus of the state of music in the first half of the seventeenth
century&mdash;&ldquo;Afterwards these (Italian <i>fantazias</i>) were imitated
by the English, who, working more elaborately, improved upon
their patterne, which gave occasion to an observation, that in
vocall the Italians, and in instrumental music the English
excelled.&rdquo; Again he alludes to &ldquo;those authors whose performance
gained the nation the credit in excelling the Italians in all
but vocall.&rdquo; In instrumental music, then, in the madrigal, the
cantata, and in ecclesiastical music, England prospered. Among
her most important composers were John Dowland, Ford,
Henry Lawes, John Jenkens, Pelham Humphreys, Wise, Blow,
Henry Purcell&mdash;great in secular and ecclesiastical works, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xiii]</a></span>
instrumental and in vocal&mdash;Croft and Weldon; all were predecessors
of Handel, who, though one of the greatest of German
composers, lived nearly fifty years in England, composed
several operas and all his famous oratorios for England, and is
therefore not unjustifiably added to the list of English composers.</p>

<p>The opera was first introduced into France by Cardinal
Mazarin early in the seventeenth century, but the lyrical drama
owes its origin in that country to Lulli, who also introduced into
it the ballet, which was a favourite pastime of the young king
Louis XIV. The ballet has since become an integral part of the
French and also of the later Italian operas. It was Lulli,
again, who extended the &ldquo;meagre prelude&rdquo; of the Italian opera
into the overture as we now know it. But as the rise and
progress of the French opera is fully portrayed in the following
musical sketches, it is needless to trace it further here.</p>

<p>Germany&mdash;equally with Italy the land of music, but of harmonious
in contra-distinction to melodic music, which belongs
most properly to Italy, well named the land of song&mdash;was much
later in developing her musical powers than Italy, but she cultivated
them to grander and nobler proportions; for to Germany
we owe the magnificent development of instrumental music, which
culminates in the form of the sonata for the piano, and in that of
the symphony for the orchestra, in the hands of such masters
as Bach, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven. In Germany the opera took
root by means of a translation of Rinaccini&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dafne,&rdquo; set to
music by Henry Sch&uuml;tz in 1627, with Italian airs and German
recitative. The first German opera or <i>singspiel</i>, &ldquo;Adam und
Eva,&rdquo; by Johann Theil, was performed in 1678, but it became
national through the works of Reinhard Keiser, whose opera
&ldquo;Basilino&rdquo; was performed in 1693. &ldquo;His style was purely
German, less remarkable for its rhetorical perfection than that
of Lulli, but exhibiting far greater variety of expression, and
more earnest endeavour to attain that spirit of Dramatic Truth
which alone can render such music worthy of its intended
purpose.&rdquo; He was worthily followed by Hasse, Grann, by
Mozart&rsquo;s &ldquo;Le Nozze di Figaro,&rdquo; &ldquo;Die Zauberfl&ouml;te,&rdquo; &ldquo;Don
Giovanni,&rdquo; and by Beethoven&rsquo;s one opera &ldquo;Fidelio.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The growth of a national opera in Germany and France,
competing with that of Italy, induced also the rise of party
quarrels between the adherents of the several schools; and the
history of music demonstrates the fact, often seen in the history
of politics, that in such contentions the real point at issue&mdash;the
<em>excellence</em> of the subject in question&mdash;is lost sight of in the fierce
strife of opponents; the broader issues are obscured in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xiv]</a></span>
narrowing influences of mere partizanship, wherein each side on
principle shuts its eyes equally to the merits of its adversary
and to its own faults. Thus in the following sketches are recorded
the quarrels between the adherents of Lulli and Rameau,
Handel and Bonacini, Piccini and Gluck, Mozart and Salieri,
Weber and Rossini, and in the present day between the
advocates of Wagner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Music of the Future&rdquo; and those of
the &ldquo;Music of the Past.&rdquo; &ldquo;The old order changes, giving
place to new,&rdquo; but only after a long protracted struggle, a
struggle that will not be productive of good as long as the
bitterness of partizanship exists, whose aim is wholly to annihilate
its adversary, though thereby much that is good and
fine be lost. This is not, however, the place to discuss the
importance of such strife, nor the comparative advantages and
disadvantages of its existence or non-existence&mdash;but it is as well
to draw attention to it in order to point out that in the history
of music the belligerents are usually blind to the important
fact that, inasmuch as nations differ essentially in ways of
thought and action, in character, temperament, and fundamental
nature, so also must the various phases of art differ which are
their mediums of expression.</p>

<p>The history of the art of music is divisible into two great
epochs&mdash;the first dating from its birth about three centuries
ago under the impelling influences of the Renaissance, to the
end of the eighteenth century, when pseudo-classicism had
given all it had to give; the second dating from the rise of Romanticism
in the beginning of the nineteenth century to the present
day. The revival of the &ldquo;forgotten world of old romance&mdash;that
world of wonder and mystery and spiritual beauty,&rdquo; no
longer crippled by lack of science, and fettered by asceticism,
was to music, that youngest of the arts, a novel influence, which
pushed it vigorously in a new direction, towards the more
direct expression of the cravings of humanity&mdash;making it more
<em>human</em>, more the fitting medium expression of this democratic
age. The true romantic feeling has been described as &ldquo;the
ever present apprehension of the spiritual world, and of that
struggle of the soul with earthly conditions.&rdquo; This later period
gave &ldquo;new seeing to our eyes, which were once more opened to
the mysteries and the wonder of the universe, and the romance
of man&rsquo;s destiny; it revived, in short, the romantic spirit enriched
by the clarity and sanity that the renascence was able to
lend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the opera Gluck was one of the earliest masters who came
under the influence of the new movement, and he anticipated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xv]</a></span>
Wagner in many of his reforms. He decreased the importance
of the singer, and increased that of the orchestra, elaborated the
recitative, and made the music to follow the rhythm of the words,
and he also gave importance to the dramatic expression of the
human emotions. In Germany Weber is styled the Father of
the Romantic opera, as in France the most noteworthy figure is
Berlioz, and the new method was further developed in the instrumental
music by Schumann, and demonstrated by other
musicians, dead and living, who, from the limited space of this
volume, have not been specially noticed&mdash;Liszt, Franz, Thomas,
Brahms, Rubenstein, Dvor&aacute;k, Massinet, Bizet, Jensen, Grieg, and
others. Gounod, is, of course, unmistakably under the same influence,
and may be considered as the direct descendant of Gluck,
and there is every reason to suppose that he is the last great composer
of the grand opera of France, as Verdi is undeniably that
of the Italian opera. The most remarkable figure of the movement,
he who has carried it to its utmost limits, is Richard
Wagner. At first he refused for his compositions the name of
&ldquo;Music of the Future,&rdquo; and desired for them the more comprehensive
term of &ldquo;Work of Art of the Future.&rdquo; It is impossible
to predict to what extent his theories will be followed: it is
not desirable that they should be blindly worked out by
musicians of power inferior to his; but they are in the right
direction, and may ultimately bring about a new art mode in
music. The resources of art are endless, being, as the Abb&eacute;
Lamennais tells us, to man what creation is to God; and music
may safely be trusted to develop in such a way as to ever be
the most fitting expression of the inarticulate cravings and
aspirations of the human soul. Wagner has attempted to
unite the three arts of Painting, Poetry, and Music: and
of his work a competent judge has written&mdash;&ldquo;The musical drama
is undoubtedly the highest manifestation of which men are capable.
All the most refined arts are called in to contribute
to the idea. The author of a musical drama is no more a
musician, or a poet, or a painter; he is the supreme <em>artist</em>, not
fettered by the limits of one art, but able to step over the
boundaries of all the different branches of &aelig;sthetic composition,
and find the proper means for rendering his thought wherever
he wants it. This was Wagner&rsquo;s aim. His latter works,
&lsquo;Tristram and Isolde,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Niebelungen Ring,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Parsifal,&rsquo; are the actuation of the theory, or at least are
works showing what is the way towards the aim.&rdquo; Another
eminent critic, Mr. Walter Pater, writing upon the fine arts,
tells us that &ldquo;<i>All art constantly aspires towards the condition of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xvi]</a></span>
music</i>.... It is the art of music which most completely
realises this artistic ideal, this perfect identification of form and
matter. In its ideal consummate moments, the end is not
distinct from the means, the form from the matter, the subject
from the expression; they inhere in and completely saturate
each other; and to it, therefore, to the condition of its perfect
moments, all the arts may be supposed constantly to tend and
aspire. Music, then, and not poetry, as is so often supposed, is
the true type or measure of consummate art. Therefore,
although each art has its incommunicable element, its untranslatable
order of impressions, its unique mode of reaching
the &lsquo;imaginative reason,&rsquo; yet the arts may be represented as
continually struggling after the law or principle of music, to a
condition which music alone completely realises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We may rest assured&mdash;as assured as Emerson or Matthew
Arnold concerning the illimitable possibilities of poetry&mdash;that
the future has great riches in store for all lovers of music.
Giants, indeed, are they who are no longer among us, but it is not
derogatory to these great ones to believe and hope that&mdash;life being
&ldquo;moving music&rdquo; according to the definition of the Syrian
Gnostics&mdash;the world will yet be electrified by the genius of
successors worthy of such royal ancestry as Handel and Mozart,
Beethoven and Wagner.</p>

<p class="center padtop xlrgfont">THE GREAT COMPOSERS.</p>

<p class="center vlrgfont">[GERMAN.]</p>



<h2 class="padtop"><a name="bach" id="bach"></a><i>BACH.</i></h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="dcapt2"><span class="dcap">T</span></span>HE growth and development of German music
are eminently noteworthy facts in the history
of the fine arts. In little more than a century
and a-half it reached its present high and
brilliant place, its progress being so consecutive
and regular that the composers who illustrated its well-defined
epochs might fairly have linked hands in one
connected series.</p>

<p>To <span class="smcap">Johann Sebastian Bach</span> must be accorded the title
of &ldquo;father of modern music.&rdquo; All succeeding composers have
bowed with reverence before his name, and acknowledged
in him the creative mind which not only placed music on a
deep scientific basis, but perfected the form from which
have been developed the wonderfully rich and varied phases
of orchestral composition. Handel, who was his contemporary,
having been born the same year, spoke of him
with sincere admiration, and called him the giant of music.
Haydn wrote&mdash;&ldquo;Whoever understands me knows that I
owe much to Sebastian Bach, that I have studied him
thoroughly and well, and that I acknowledge him only as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
my model.&rdquo; Mozart&rsquo;s unceasing research brought to light
many of his unpublished manuscripts, and helped Germany
to a full appreciation of this great master. In like manner
have the other luminaries of music placed on record their sense
of obligation to one whose name is obscure to the general
public in comparison with many of his brother composers.</p>

<p>Sebastian Bach was born at Eisenach on the 21st of
March 1685, the son of one of the court musicians. Left
in the care of his elder brother, who was an organist, his
brilliant powers displayed themselves at an early period.
He was the descendant of a race of musicians, and even at
that date the wide-spread branches of the family held
annual gatherings of a musical character. Young Bach
mastered for himself, without much assistance, a thorough
musical education at L&uuml;neburg, where he studied in the
gymnasium and sang in the cathedral choir; and at the age
of eighteen we find him court musician at Weimar, where a
few years later he became organist and director of concerts.
He had in the meantime studied the organ at L&uuml;beck under
the celebrated Buxtehude, and made himself thoroughly a
master of the great Italian composers of sacred music&mdash;Palestrina,
Lotti, Vivaldi, and others.</p>

<p>At this period Germany was beginning to experience its
musical <i>renaissance</i>. The various German courts felt that
throb of life and enthusiasm which had distinguished the
Italian principalities in the preceding century in the
direction of painting and sculpture. Every little capital
was a focus of artistic rays, and there was a general spirit
of rivalry among the princes, who aspired to cultivate the
arts of peace as well as those of war. Bach had become
known as a gifted musician, not only by his wonderful
powers as an organist, but by two of his earlier masterpieces&mdash;&ldquo;Gott
ist mein K&ouml;nig&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ich hatte viel
Bek&uuml;mmerniss.&rdquo; Under the influence of an atmosphere so
artistic, Bach&rsquo;s ardour for study increased with his success,
and his rapid advancement in musical power met with
warm appreciation.</p>

<p>While Bach held the position of director of the chapel of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
Prince Leopold of Anhalt-K&ouml;then, which he assumed about
the year 1720, he went to Hamburg on a pilgrimage to see
old Reinke, then nearly a centenarian, whose fame as an
organist was national, and had long been the object of
Bach&rsquo;s enthusiasm. The aged man listened while his
youthful rival improvised on the old choral, &ldquo;Upon the
Rivers of Babylon.&rdquo; He shed tears of joy while he tenderly
embraced Bach, and said&mdash;&ldquo;I did think that this art would
die with me; but I see that you will keep it alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our musician rapidly became known far and wide
throughout the musical centres of Germany as a learned and
recondite composer, as a brilliant improviser, and as an
organist beyond rivalry. Yet it was in these last two
capacities that his reputation among his contemporaries was
the most marked. It was left to a succeeding generation to
fully enlighten the world in regard to his creative powers
as a musical thinker.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Though Bach&rsquo;s life was mostly spent at Weimar and
Leipsic, he was at successive periods chapel-master and
concert-director at several of the German courts, which
aspired to shape public taste in matters of musical culture
and enthusiasm. But he was by nature singularly retiring
and unobtrusive, and recoiled from several brilliant offers
which would have brought him too much in contact with
the gay world of fashion, apparently dreading any diversion
from a severe and exclusive art-life; for within these limits
all his hopes, energies, and wishes were focalised. Yet he
was not without that keen spirit of rivalry, that love of
combat, which seems to be native to spirits of the more
robust and energetic type.</p>

<p>In the days of the old Minnesingers, tournaments of
music shared the public taste with tournaments of arms.
In Bach&rsquo;s time these public competitions were still in vogue.
One of these was held by Augustus II., Elector of Saxony
and King of Poland, one of the most munificent art-patrons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
of Europe, but best known to fame from his intimate part
in the wars of Charles XII. of Sweden and Peter the Great
of Russia. Here Bach&rsquo;s principal rival was a French
<i>virtuoso</i>, Marchand, who, an exile from Paris, had delighted
the king by the lightness and brilliancy of his execution.
They were both to improvise on the same theme. Marchand
heard Bach&rsquo;s performance and signalised his own inferiority
by declining to play, and secretly leaving the city of
Dresden. Augustus sent Bach a hundred louis d&rsquo;or, but
this splendid <i>douceur</i> never reached him, as it was
appropriated by one of the court officials.</p>

<p>In Bach&rsquo;s half-century of a studious musical life there is
but little of stirring incident to record. The significance
of his career was interior, not exterior. Twice married, and
the father of twenty children, his income was always small
even for that age. Yet, by frugality, the simple wants of
himself and his family never overstepped the limit of supply;
for he seems to have been happily mated with wives who
sympathised with his exclusive devotion to art, and united
with this the virtues of old-fashioned German thrift.</p>

<p>Three years before his death, Bach, who had a son in the
service of the King of Prussia, yielded to the urgent invitation
of that monarch to go to Berlin. Frederick II., the
conqueror of Rossbach, and one of the greatest of modern
soldiers, was a passionate lover of literature and art, and it
was his pride to collect at his court all the leading lights of
European culture. He was not only the patron of Voltaire,
whose connection with the Prussian monarch has furnished
such rich material to the anecdote-history of literature, but
of all the distinguished painters, poets, and musicians whom
he could persuade by his munificent offers (but rarely
fulfilled) to suffer the burden of his eccentricities. Frederick
was not content with playing the part of patron, but must
himself also be poet, philosopher, painter, and composer.</p>

<p>On the night of Bach&rsquo;s arrival Frederick was taking part
in a concert at his palace, and, on hearing that the great
musician whose name was in the mouths of all Germany
had come, immediately sent for him without allowing him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
to don a court dress, interrupting his concert with the
enthusiastic announcement, &ldquo;Gentlemen, Bach is here.&rdquo;
The cordial hospitality and admiration of Frederick was
gratefully acknowledged by Bach, who dedicated to him a
three-part fugue on a theme composed by the king, known
under the name of &ldquo;A Musical Offering.&rdquo; But he could
not be persuaded to remain long from his Leipsic home.</p>

<p>Shortly before Bach&rsquo;s death, he was seized with blindness,
brought on by incessant labour; and his end was supposed
to have been hastened by the severe inflammation consequent
on two operations performed by an English oculist. He
departed this life July 30, 1750, and was buried in St.
John&rsquo;s churchyard, universally mourned by musical
Germany, though his real title to exceptional greatness was
not to be read until the next generation.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Sebastian Bach was not only the descendant of a widely-known
musical family, but was himself the direct ancestor
of about sixty of the best-known organists and church
composers of Germany. As a master of organ-playing,
tradition tells us that no one has been his equal, with the
possible exception of Handel. He was also an able
performer on various stringed instruments, and his
preference for the clavichord<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> led him to write a method
for that instrument, which has been the basis of all succeeding
methods for the piano. Bach&rsquo;s teachings and influence
may be said to have educated a large number of excellent
composers and organ and piano players, among whom were
Emanuel Bach, Cramer, Hummel, and Clementi; and on
his school of theory and practice the best results in music
have been built.</p>

<p>That Bach&rsquo;s glory as a composer should be largely
posthumous is probably the result of his exceeding simplicity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
and diffidence, for he always shrank from popular applause;
therefore we may believe his compositions were not placed
in the proper light during his life. It was through Mozart,
Haydn, and Beethoven, that the musical world learned what
a master-spirit had wrought in the person of John Sebastian
Bach. The first time Mozart heard one of Bach&rsquo;s hymns,
he said, &ldquo;Thank God! I learn something absolutely new.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bach&rsquo;s great compositions include his &ldquo;Preludes and
Fugues&rdquo; for the organ, works so difficult and elaborate as
perhaps to be above the average comprehension, but sources
of delight and instruction to all musicians; the &ldquo;Matth&auml;us
Passion,&rdquo; for two choruses and two orchestras, one of the
masterpieces in music, which was not produced till a century
after it was written; the &ldquo;Oratorio of the Nativity of
Jesus Christ;&rdquo; and a very large number of masses, anthems,
cantatas, chorals, hymns, etc. These works, from their
largeness and dignity of form, as also from their depth of
musical science, have been to all succeeding composers an
art-armoury, whence they have derived and furbished their
brightest weapons. In the study of Bach&rsquo;s works the
student finds the deepest and highest reaches in the science
of music; for his mind seems to have grasped all its
resources, and to have embodied them with austere purity
and precision of form. As Spenser is called the poet for
poets, and Laplace the mathematician for mathematicians,
so Bach is the musician for musicians. While Handel may
be considered a purely independent and parallel growth, it
is not too much to assert that without Sebastian Bach and
his matchless studies for the piano, organ, and orchestra, we
could not have had the varied musical development in
sonata and symphony from such masters as Haydn, Mozart,
and Beethoven. Three of Sebastian Bach&rsquo;s sons became
distinguished musicians, and to Emanuel we owe the
artistic development of the sonata, which in its turn became
the foundation of the symphony.</p>

<h2><a name="handel" id="handel"></a><i>HANDEL.</i></h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> the modern Englishman Handel is almost a contemporary.
Paintings and busts of this great minstrel are
scattered everywhere throughout the land. He lies in
Westminster Abbey among the great poets, warriors, and
statesmen, a giant memory in his noble art. A few hours
after death the sculptor Roubiliac took a cast of his face,
which he wrought into imperishable marble; &ldquo;moulded in
colossal calm,&rdquo; he towers above his tomb, and accepts the
homage of the world benignly like a god. Exeter Hall
and the Foundling Hospital in London are also adorned
with marble statues of him.</p>

<p>There are more than fifty known pictures of Handel,
some of them by distinguished artists. In the best of these
pictures Handel is seated in the gay costume of the period,
with sword, shot-silk breeches, and coat embroidered with
gold. The face is noble in its repose. Benevolence is
seated about the finely-shaped mouth, and the face wears
the mellow dignity of years, without weakness or austerity.
There are few collectors of prints in England and America
who have not a woodcut or a lithograph of him. His face
and his music are alike familiar to the English-speaking
world.</p>

<p>Handel came to England in the year 1710, at the age of
twenty-five. Four years before he had met, at Naples,
Scarlatti, Porpora, and Corelli. That year had been the
turning-point in his life. With one stride he reached the
front rank, and felt that no musician alive could teach him
anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George Frederick Handel</span> (or H&auml;ndel, as the name
is written in German) was born at Halle, Lower Saxony, in
the year 1685. Like German literature, German music is
a comparatively recent growth. What little feeling existed
for the musical art employed itself in cultivating the alien
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
flowers of Italian song. Even eighty years after this
Mozart and Haydn were treated like lackeys and vagabonds,
just as great actors were treated in England at the
same period. Handel&rsquo;s father looked on music as an
occupation having very little dignity.</p>

<p>Determined that his young son should become a doctor like
himself, and leave the divine art to Italian fiddlers and French
buffoons, he did not allow him to go to a public school even,
for fear he should learn the gamut. But the boy Handel,
passionately fond of sweet sounds, had, with the connivance
of his nurse, hidden in the garret a poor spinet, and in
stolen hours taught himself how to play. At last the senior
Handel had a visit to make to another son in the service
of the Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, and the young George
was taken along to the ducal palace. The boy strayed into
the chapel, and was irresistibly drawn to the organ. His
stolen performance was made known to his father and the
duke, and the former was very much enraged at such a direct
evidence of disobedience. The duke, however, being astonished
at the performance of the youthful genius, interceded for
him, and recommended that his taste should be encouraged
and cultivated instead of repressed.</p>

<p>From this time forward fortune showered upon him a
combination of conditions highly favourable to rapid
development. Severe training, ardent friendship, the
society of the first composers, and incessant practice were
vouchsafed him. As the pupil of the great organist
Zachau, he studied the whole existing mass of German and
Italian music, and soon exacted from his master the
admission that he had nothing more to teach him. Thence
he went to Berlin to study the opera-school, where Ariosti
and Bononcini were favourite composers. The first was
friendly, but the latter, who with a first-rate head had a
cankered heart, determined to take the conceit out of the
Saxon boy. He challenged him to play at sight an elaborate
piece. Handel played it with perfect precision, and
thenceforward Bononcini, though he hated the youth as
a rival, treated him as an equal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
On the death of his father Handel secured an
engagement at the Hamburg opera-house, where he soon
made his mark by the ability with which, on several
occasions, he conducted rehearsals.</p>

<p>At the age of nineteen Handel received the offer of the
L&uuml;beck organ, on condition that he would marry the
daughter of the retiring organist. He went down with his
friend Mattheson, who it seems had been offered the same
terms. They both returned, however, in single blessedness
to Hamburg.</p>

<p>Though the L&uuml;beck maiden had stirred no bad blood
between them, musical rivalry did. A dispute in the
theatre resulted in a duel. The only thing that saved
Handel&rsquo;s life was a great brass button that shivered his
antagonist&rsquo;s point, when they were parted to become firm
friends again.</p>

<p>While at Hamburg Handel&rsquo;s first two operas were
composed, &ldquo;Almira&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nero.&rdquo; Both of these were
founded on dark tales of crime and sorrow, and, in spite of
some beautiful airs and clever instrumentation, were
musical failures, as might be expected.</p>

<p>Handel had had enough of manufacturing operas in
Germany, and so in July 1706 he went to Florence.
Here he was cordially received; for Florence was second
to no city in Italy in its passion for encouraging the arts.
Its noble specimens of art creations in architecture, painting,
and sculpture produced a powerful impression upon
the young musician. In little more than a week&rsquo;s time he
composed an opera, &ldquo;Rodrigo,&rdquo; for which he obtained one
hundred sequins. His next visit was to Venice, where he
arrived at the height of the carnival. Whatever effect
Venice, with its weird and mysterious beauty, with its
marble palaces, fa&ccedil;ades, pillars, and domes, its magnificent
shrines and frescoes, produced on Handel, he took Venice
by storm. Handel&rsquo;s power as an organist and a harpsichord
player was only second to his strength as a composer,
even when, in the full zenith of his maturity, he composed
the &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; and &ldquo;Judas Maccab&aelig;us.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
&ldquo;Il caro Sassone,&rdquo; the dear Saxon, found a formidable
opponent as well as dear friend in the person of Scarlatti.
One night at a masked ball, given by a nobleman, Handel
was present in disguise. He sat at the harpsichord, and
astonished the company with his playing; but no one could
tell who it was that ravished the ears of the assembly.
Presently another masquerader came into the room, walked
up to the instrument, and called out: &ldquo;It is either the
devil or the Saxon!&rdquo; This was Scarlatti, who afterwards
had with Handel, in Florence and Rome, friendly contests
of skill, in which it seemed difficult to decide which was
victor. To satisfy the Venetian public, Handel composed
the opera &ldquo;Agrippina,&rdquo; which made a <i>furore</i> among all the
connoisseurs of the city.</p>

<p>So, having seen the summer in Florence and the carnival
in Venice, he must hurry on to be in time for the great
Easter celebrations in Rome. Here he lived under the
patronage of Cardinal Ottoboni, one of the wealthiest and
most liberal of the Sacred College. The cardinal was a
modern representative of the ancient patrician. Living
himself in princely luxury, he endowed hospitals and
surgeries for the public. He distributed alms, patronised
men of science and art, and entertained the public with
comedies, operas, oratorios, puppet-shows, and academic
disputes. Under the auspices of this patron, Handel
composed three operas and two oratorios. Even at this
early period the young composer was parting company
with the strict old musical traditions, and his works
showed an extraordinary variety and strength of treatment.</p>

<p>From Rome he went to Naples, where he spent his
second Italian summer, and composed the original Italian
&ldquo;Aci e Galatea,&rdquo; which in its English version, afterwards
written for the Duke of Chandos, has continued a marked
favourite with the musical world. Thence, after a lingering
return through the sunny land where he had been so
warmly welcomed, and which had taught him most
effectually, in convincing him that his musical life had
nothing in common with the traditions of Italian musical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
art, he returned to Germany, settling at the court of
George of Brunswick, Elector of Hanover, and afterwards
King of England. He received commission in the course
of a few months from the elector to visit England, having
been warmly invited thither by some English noblemen.
On his return to Hanover, at the end of six months, he
found the dull and pompous little court unspeakably tiresome
after the bustle of London. So it is not to be
marvelled at that he took the earliest opportunity of
returning to the land which he afterwards adopted. At this
period he was not yet twenty-five years old, but already
famous as a performer on the organ and harpsichord, and
as a composer of Italian operas.</p>

<p>When Queen Anne died and Handel&rsquo;s old patron became
King of England, Handel was forbidden to appear before
him, as he had not forgotten the musician&rsquo;s escapade; but
his peace was at last made by a little ruse. Handel had a
friend at court, Baron Kilmansegge, from whom he learned
that the king was, on a certain day, going to take an
excursion on the Thames. So he set to work to compose
music for the occasion, which he arranged to have performed
on a boat which followed the king&rsquo;s barge. As the king
floated down the river he heard the new and delightful
&ldquo;Water-Music.&rdquo; He knew that only one man could have
composed such music; so he sent for Handel, and sealed
his pardon with a pension of two hundred pounds a-year.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Let us take a glance at the society in which the composer
moved in the heyday of his youth. His greatness was to
be perfected in after-years by bitter rivalries, persecution,
alternate oscillations of poverty and affluence, and a multitude
of bitter experiences. But at this time Handel&rsquo;s life
was a serene and delightful one. Rival factions had not
been organised to crush him. Lord Burlington lived much
at his mansion, which was then out of town, although the
house is now in the heart of Piccadilly. The intimate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
friendship of this nobleman helped to bring the young
musician into contact with many distinguished people.</p>

<p>It is odd to think of the people Handel met daily
without knowing that their names and his would be in a
century famous. The following picture sketches Handel
and his friends in a sprightly fashion:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yonder heavy, ragged-looking youth standing at the
corner of Regent Street, with a slight and rather more
refined-looking companion, is the obscure Samuel Johnson,
quite unknown to fame. He is walking with Richard
Savage. As Signor Handel, &lsquo;the composer of Italian
music,&rsquo; passes by, Savage becomes excited, and nudges his
friend, who takes only a languid interest in the foreigner.
Johnson did not care for music; of many noises he considered
it the least disagreeable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toward Charing Cross comes, in shovel-hat and cassock,
the renowned ecclesiastic, Dean Swift. He has just nodded
patronisingly to Bononcini in the Strand, and suddenly
meets Handel, who cuts him dead. Nothing disconcerted,
the dean moves on, muttering his famous epigram&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Some say that Signor Bononcini,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Compared to Handel, is a ninny;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While others vow that to him Handel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is hardly fit to hold a candle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange that such difference should be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&rsquo;Twixt tweedledum and tweedledee.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;As Handel enters the &lsquo;Turk&rsquo;s Head&rsquo; at the corner of
Regent Street, a noble coach and four drives up. It is the
Duke of Chandos, who is inquiring for Mr. Pope. Presently
a deformed little man, in an iron-grey suit, and with a face
as keen as a razor, hobbles out, makes a low bow to the
burly Handel, who, helping him into the chariot, gets in
after him, and they drive off together to Cannons, the
duke&rsquo;s mansion at Edgeware. There they meet Mr.
Addison, the poet Gay, and the witty Arbuthnot, who have
been asked to luncheon. The last number of the <i>Spectator</i>
is on the table, and a brisk discussion soon arises between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
Pope and Addison concerning the merits of the Italian
opera, in which Pope would have the better if he only
knew a little more about music, and could keep his temper.
Arbuthnot sides with Pope in favour of Mr. Handel&rsquo;s
operas; the duke endeavours to keep the peace. Handel
probably uses his favourite exclamation, &lsquo;Vat te tevil I
care!&rsquo; and consumes the <i>recherch&eacute;</i> wines and rare viands
with undiminished gusto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Magnificent, or the Grand Duke, as he was called,
had built himself a palace for &pound;230,000. He had a private
chapel, and appointed Handel organist in the room of the
celebrated Dr. Pepusch, who retired with excellent grace
before one manifestly his superior. On week-days the duke
and duchess entertained all the wits and grandees in town,
and on Sundays the Edgeware Road was thronged with the
gay equipages of those who went to worship at the ducal
chapel and hear Mr. Handel play on the organ.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Edgeware Road was a pleasant country drive, but
parts of it were so solitary that highwaymen were much to
be feared. The duke was himself attacked on one occasion;
and those who could afford it never travelled so far out of
town without armed retainers. Cannons was the pride of
the neighbourhood, and the duke&mdash;of whom Pope wrote,</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Thus gracious Chandos is beloved at sight&rsquo;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>was as popular as he was wealthy. But his name is made
still more illustrious by the Chandos anthems. They were
all written at Cannons between 1718 and 1720, and
number in all eleven overtures, thirty-two solos, six duets,
a trio, quartet, and forty-seven choruses. Some of the
above are real masterpieces; but, with the exception of
&lsquo;The waves of the sea rage horribly,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Who is God
but the Lord?&rsquo; few of them are ever heard now. And
yet these anthems were most significant in the variety of
the choruses and in the range of the accompaniments; and
it was then, no doubt, that Handel was feeling his way
toward the great and immortal sphere of his oratorio music.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
Indeed, his first oratorio, &lsquo;Esther,&rsquo; was composed at
Cannons, as also the English version of &lsquo;Acis and
Galatea.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Handel had other associates, and we must now visit
Thomas Britton, the musical coal-heaver. &ldquo;There goes the
famous small-coal man, a lover of learning, a musician,
and a companion of gentlemen.&rdquo; So the folks used to say
as Thomas Britton, the coal-heaver of Clerkenwell Green,
paced up and down the neighbouring streets with his sack
of small coal on his back, destined for one of his customers.
Britton was great among the great. He was courted by
the most fashionable folk of his day. He was a cultivated
coal-heaver, who, besides his musical taste and ability,
possessed an extensive knowledge of chemistry and the
occult sciences.</p>

<p>Britton did more than this. He gave concerts in
Aylesbury Street, Clerkenwell, where this singular man
had formed a dwelling-house, with a concert-room and a
coal-store, out of what was originally a stable. On the
ground-floor was the small-coal repository, and over that
the concert-room&mdash;very long and narrow, badly lighted,
and with a ceiling so low that a tall man could scarcely
stand upright in it. The stairs to this room were far
from pleasant to ascend, and the following facetious lines
by Ward, the author of the &ldquo;London Spy,&rdquo; confirm this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Upon Thursdays repair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To my palace, and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hobble up stair by stair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I pray ye take care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you break not your shins by a stumble;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;And without e&rsquo;er a souse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paid to me or my spouse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sit as still as a mouse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the top of the house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there you shall hear how we fumble.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nevertheless, beautiful duchesses and the best society in
town flocked to Britton&rsquo;s on Thursdays&mdash;not to order coals,
but to sit out his concerts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
Let us follow the short, stout little man on a concert-day.
The customers are all served, or as many as can be. The
coal-shed is made tidy and swept up, and the coal-heaver
awaits his company. There he stands at the door of his
stable, dressed in his blue blouse, dustman&rsquo;s hat, and
maroon kerchief tightly fastened round his neck. The
concert-room is almost full, and, pipe in hand, Britton
awaits a new visitor&mdash;the beautiful Duchess of B&mdash;&mdash;.
She is somewhat late (the coachman, possibly, is not quite
at home in the neighbourhood).</p>

<p>Here comes a carriage, which stops at the coal-shop;
and, laying down his pipe, the coal-heaver assists her grace
to alight, and in the genteelest manner escorts her to the
narrow staircase leading to the music-room. Forgetting
Ward&rsquo;s advice, she trips laughingly and carelessly up the
stairs to the room, from which proceed faint sounds of
music, increasing to quite an <i>olla podrida</i> of sound as the
apartment is reached&mdash;for the musicians are tuning up.
The beautiful duchess is soon recognised, and as soon in
deep gossip with her friends. But who is that gentlemanly
man leaning over the chamber-organ? That is Sir Roger
L&rsquo;Estrange, an admirable performer on the violoncello,
and a great lover of music. He is watching the subtile
fingering of Mr. Handel, as his dimpled hands drift
leisurely and marvellously over the keys of the instrument.</p>

<p>There, too, is Mr. Bannister with his fiddle&mdash;the first
Englishman, by-the-by, who distinguished himself upon the
violin; there is Mr. Woolaston, the painter, relating to
Dr. Pepusch of how he had that morning thrown up his
window upon hearing Britton crying &ldquo;Small coal!&rdquo; near
his house in Warwick Lane, and, having beckoned him in,
had made a sketch for a painting of him; there, too, is
Mr. John Hughes, author of the &ldquo;Siege of Damascus.&rdquo;
In the background also are Mr. Philip Hart, Mr. Henry
Symonds, Mr. Obadiah Shuttleworth, Mr. Abiell Whichello;
while in the extreme corner of the room is Robe, a justice
of the peace, letting out to Henry Needler of the Excise
Office the last bit of scandal that has come into his court.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
And now, just as the concert has commenced, in creeps
&ldquo;Soliman the Magnificent,&rdquo; also known as Mr. Charles
Jennens, of Great Ormond Street, who wrote many of
Handel&rsquo;s librettos, and arranged the words for the
&ldquo;Messiah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soliman the Magnificent&rdquo; is evidently resolved to do
justice to his title on this occasion, with his carefully-powdered
wig, frills, maroon-coloured coat, and buckled
shoes; and as he makes his progress up the room, the
company draw aside for him to reach his favourite seat
near Handel. A trio of Corelli&rsquo;s is gone through; then
Madame Cuzzoni sings Handel&rsquo;s last new air; Dr. Pepusch
takes his turn at the harpsichord; another trio of Hasse,
or a solo on the violin by Bannister; a selection on the
organ from Mr. Handel&rsquo;s new oratorio; and then the day&rsquo;s
programme is over. Dukes, duchesses, wits and philosophers,
poets and musicians, make their way down the
satirised stairs to go, some in carriages, some in chairs,
some on foot, to their own palaces, houses, or lodgings.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>We do not now think of Handel in connection with the
opera. To the modern mind he is so linked to the oratorio,
of which he was the father and the consummate master, that
his operas are curiosities but little known except to musical
antiquaries. Yet some of the airs from the Handel operas
are still cherished by singers as among the most beautiful
songs known to the concert-stage.</p>

<p>In 1720 Handel was engaged by a party of noblemen,
headed by his Grace of Chandos, to compose operas for the
Royal Academy of Music at the Haymarket. An attempt
had been made to put this institution on a firm foundation
by a subscription of &pound;50,000, and it was opened on May 2nd
with a full company of singers engaged by Handel. In the
course of eight years twelve operas were produced in rapid
succession: &ldquo;Floridante,&rdquo; December 9, 1721; &ldquo;Ottone,&rdquo;
January 12, 1723; &ldquo;Flavio&rdquo; and &ldquo;Giulio Cesare,&rdquo; 1723;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
&ldquo;Tamerlano,&rdquo; 1724; &ldquo;Rodelinda,&rdquo; 1725; &ldquo;Scipione,&rdquo; 1726;
&ldquo;Alessandro,&rdquo; 1726; &ldquo;Admeto,&rdquo; 1727; &ldquo;Siroe,&rdquo; 1728;
and &ldquo;Tolommeo,&rdquo; 1728. They made as great a <i>furore</i>
among the musical public of that day as would an opera
from Gounod or Verdi in the present. The principal airs
were sung throughout the land, and published as harpsichord
pieces; for in these halcyon days of our composers the whole
atmosphere of the land was full of the flavour and colour of
Handel. Many of the melodies in these now forgotten
operas have been worked up by modern composers, and so
have passed into modern music unrecognised. It is a
notorious fact that the celebrated song, &ldquo;Where the Bee
sucks,&rdquo; by Dr. Arne, is taken from a movement in
&ldquo;Rinaldo.&rdquo; Thus the new life of music is ever growing
rich with the dead leaves of the past. The most celebrated
of these operas was entitled &ldquo;Otto.&rdquo; It was a work composed
of one long string of exquisite gems, like Mozart&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Don Giovanni&rdquo; and Gounod&rsquo;s &ldquo;Faust.&rdquo; Dr. Pepusch,
who had never quite forgiven Handel for superseding him
as the best organist in England, remarked of one of the airs,
&ldquo;That great bear must have been inspired when he wrote
that air.&rdquo; The celebrated Madame Cuzzoni made her <i>d&eacute;but</i>
in it. On the second night the tickets rose to four guineas
each, and Cuzzoni received two thousand pounds for the
season.</p>

<p>The composer had already begun to be known for his
irascible temper. It is refreshing to learn that operatic
singers of the day, however whimsical and self-willed, were
obliged to bend to the imperious genius of this man. In a
spirit of ill-timed revolt Cuzzoni declined to sing an air.
She had already given him trouble by her insolence and
freaks, which at times were unbearable. Handel at last
exploded. He flew at the wretched woman and shook her
like a rat. &ldquo;Ah! I always knew you were a fery tevil,&rdquo;
he cried, &ldquo;and I shall now let you know that I am
Beelzebub, the prince of de tevils!&rdquo; and, dragging her to
the open window, was just on the point of pitching her into
the street, when, in every sense of the word, she recanted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
So, when Carestini, the celebrated tenor, sent back an air,
Handel was furious. Rushing into the trembling Italian&rsquo;s
house, he said, in his four-&nbsp;or five-language style&mdash;&ldquo;You
tog! don&rsquo;t I know better as yourself vaat it pest for you to
sing? If you vill not sing all de song vaat I give you, I vill
not pay you ein stiver.&rdquo; Among the anecdotes told of
Handel&rsquo;s passion is one growing out of the composer&rsquo;s
peculiar sensitiveness to discords. The dissonance of the
tuning-up period of an orchestra is disagreeable to the
most patient. Handel, being peculiarly sensitive to this
unfortunate necessity, always arranged that it should take
place before the audience assembled, so as to prevent any
sound of scraping or blowing. Unfortunately, on one
occasion, some wag got access to the orchestra where the
ready-tuned instruments were lying, and with diabolical
dexterity put every string and crook out of tune. Handel
enters. All the bows are raised together, and at the given
beat all start off <i>con spirito</i>. The effect was startling in the
extreme. The unhappy <i>maestro</i> rushes madly from his
place, kicks to pieces the first double-bass he sees, and,
seizing a kettle-drum, throws it violently at the leader of
the band. The effort sends his wig flying, and, rushing
bareheaded to the footlights, he stands a few moments amid
the roars of the house, snorting with rage and choking with
passion. Like Burleigh&rsquo;s nod, Handel&rsquo;s wig seemed to have
been a sure guide to his temper. When things went well, it
had a certain complacent vibration; but when he was out
of humour, the wig indicated the fact in a very positive
way. The Princess of Wales was wont to blame her ladies
for talking instead of listening. &ldquo;Hush, hush!&rdquo; she would
say. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see Handel&rsquo;s wig?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For several years after the subscription of the nobility
had been exhausted, our composer, having invested &pound;10,000
of his own in the Haymarket, produced operas with remarkable
affluence, some of them <i>pasticcio</i> works, composed of all
sorts of airs, in which the singers could give their <i>bravura</i>
songs. These were &ldquo;Lotario,&rdquo; 1729; &ldquo;Partenope,&rdquo; 1730;
&ldquo;Poro,&rdquo; 1731; &ldquo;Ezio,&rdquo; 1732; &ldquo;Sosarme,&rdquo; 1732; &ldquo;Orlando,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
1733; &ldquo;Ariadne,&rdquo; 1734; and also several minor works.
Handel&rsquo;s operatic career was not so much the outcome of
his choice as dictated to him by the necessity of time and
circumstance. As time went on, his operas lost public
interest. The audiences dwindled, and the overflowing
houses of his earlier experience were replaced by empty
benches. This, however, made little difference with Handel&rsquo;s
royal patrons. The king and the Prince of Wales, with
their respective households, made it an express point to
show their deep interest in Handel&rsquo;s success. In illustration
of this, an amusing anecdote is told of the Earl of
Chesterfield. During the performance of &ldquo;Rinaldo&rdquo; this
nobleman, then an equerry of the king, was met quietly
retiring from the theatre in the middle of the first act.
Surprise being expressed by a gentleman who met the earl,
the latter said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to disturb his Majesty&rsquo;s
privacy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Handel paid his singers in those days what were regarded
as enormous prices. Senisino and Carestini had each
twelve hundred pounds, and Cuzzoni two thousand, for the
season. Towards the end of what may be called the Handel
season nearly all the singers and nobles forsook him, and
supported Farinelli, the greatest singer living, at the rival
house in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>From the year 1729 the career of Handel was to be a
protracted battle, in which he was sometimes victorious,
sometimes defeated, but always undaunted and animated
with a lofty sense of his own superior power. Let us take
a view of some of the rival musicians with whom he came
in contact. Of all these Bononcini was the most formidable.
He came to England in 1720 with Ariosti, also a
meritorious composer. Factions soon began to form themselves
around Handel and Bononcini, and a bitter struggle
ensued between these old foes. The same drama repeated
itself, with new actors, about thirty years afterwards, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
Paris. Gluck was then the German hero, supported by
Marie Antoinette, and Piccini fought for the Italian opera
under the colours of the king&rsquo;s mistress, Du Barry, while
all the <i>litt&eacute;rateurs</i> and nobles ranged themselves on either
side in bitter contest. The battle between Handel and
Bononcini, as the exponents of German and Italian music,
was also repeated in after-years between Mozart and Salieri,
Weber and Rossini, and to-day is seen in the acrimonious
disputes going on between Wagner and the Italian school.
Bononcini&rsquo;s career in England came to an end very
suddenly. It was discovered that a madrigal brought out
by him was pirated from another Italian composer; whereupon
Bononcini left England, humiliated to the dust, and
finally died obscure and alone, the victim of a charlatan
alchemist, who succeeded in obtaining all his savings.</p>

<p>Another powerful rival of Handel was Porpora, or, as
Handel used to call him, &ldquo;Old Borbora.&rdquo; Without
Bononcini&rsquo;s fire or Handel&rsquo;s daring originality, he represented
the dry contrapuntal school of Italian music. He
was also a great singing master, famous throughout Europe,
and upon this his reputation had hitherto principally rested.
He came to London in 1733, under the patronage of the
Italian faction, especially to serve as a thorn in the side of
Handel. His first opera, &ldquo;Ariadne,&rdquo; was a great success;
but when he had the audacity to challenge the great
German in the field of oratorio, his defeat was so overwhelming
that he candidly admitted his rival&rsquo;s superiority.
But he believed that no operas in the world were equal to
his own, and he composed fifty of them during his life,
extending to the days of Haydn, whom he had the honour
of teaching, while the father of the symphony, on the other
hand, cleaned Porpora&rsquo;s boots and powdered his wig for
him.</p>

<p>Another Italian opponent was Hasse, a man of true
genius, who in his old age instructed some of the most
splendid singers in the history of the lyric stage. He also
married one of the most gifted and most beautiful divas of
Europe, Faustina Bordoni. The following anecdote does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
equal credit to Hasse&rsquo;s heart and penetration: In after-years,
when he had left England, he was again sent for to
take Handel&rsquo;s place as conductor of opera and oratorio.
Hasse inquired, &ldquo;What! is Handel dead?&rdquo; On being told
no, he indignantly refused, saying he was not worthy to tie
Handel&rsquo;s shoe-latchets.</p>

<p>There are also Dr. Pepusch, the Anglicised Prussian, and
Dr. Greene, both names well known in English music.
Pepusch had had the leading place, before Handel&rsquo;s arrival,
as organist and conductor, and made a distinct place for
himself even after the sun of Handel had obscured all of
his contemporaries. He wrote the music of the &ldquo;Beggar&rsquo;s
Opera,&rdquo; which was the great sensation of the times, and
which still keeps possession of the stage. Pepusch was
chiefly notable for his skill in arranging the popular songs
of the day, and probably did more than any other composer
to give the English ballad its artistic form.</p>

<p>The name of Dr. Greene is best known in connection
with choral compositions. His relations with Handel and
Bononcini are hardly creditable to him. He seems to have
flattered each in turn. He upheld Bononcini in the great
madrigal controversy, and appears to have wearied Handel
by his repeated visits. The great Saxon easily saw through
the flatteries of a man who was in reality an ambitious
rival, and joked about him, not always in the best taste.
When he was told that Greene was giving concerts at the
&ldquo;Devil Tavern,&rdquo; near Temple Bar, &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;mein poor friend, Toctor Greene&mdash;so he is gone to de
Tevil!&rdquo;</p>

<p>From 1732 to 1740 Handel&rsquo;s life presents the suggestive
and often-repeated experience in the lives of men of genius&mdash;a
soul with a great creative mission, of which it is half
unconscious, partly yielding to and partly struggling
against the tendencies of the age, yet gradually crystallising
into its true form, and getting consecrated to its true work.
In these eight years Handel presented to the public ten
operas and five oratorios. It was in 1731 that the great
significant fact, though unrecognised by himself and others,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
occurred, which stamped the true bent of his genius. This
was the production of his first oratorio in England. He
was already playing his operas to empty houses, the subject
of incessant scandal and abuse on the part of his enemies,
but holding his way with steady cheerfulness and courage.
Twelve years before this he had composed the oratorio of
&ldquo;Esther,&rdquo; but it was still in manuscript, uncared for and
neglected. It was finally produced by a society called
Philharmonic, under the direction of Bernard Gates, the
royal-chapel master. Its fame spread wide, and we read
these significant words in one of the old English newspapers&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Esther,&rsquo;
an English oratorio, was performed six
times, and very full.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shortly after this Handel himself conducted &ldquo;Esther&rdquo; at
the Haymarket by royal command. His success encouraged
him to write &ldquo;Deborah,&rdquo; another attempt in the same field,
and it met a warm reception from the public, March 17,
1733.</p>

<p>For about fifteen years Handel had struggled heroically
in the composition of Italian operas. With these he had at
first succeeded; but his popularity waned more and more,
and he became finally the continued target for satire, scorn,
and malevolence. In obedience to the drift of opinion, all
the great singers, who had supported him at the outset,
joined the rival ranks or left England. In fact, it may be
almost said that the English public were becoming dissatisfied
with the whole system and method of Italian
music. Colley Cibber, the actor and dramatist, explains
why Italian opera could never satisfy the requirement of
Handel, or be anything more than an artificial luxury in
England: &ldquo;The truth is, this kind of entertainment is
entirely sensational.&rdquo; Still both Handel and his friends
and his foes, all the exponents of musical opinion in
England, persevered obstinately in warming this foreign
exotic into a new lease of life.</p>

<p>The quarrel between the great Saxon composer and his
opponents raged incessantly both in public and private.
The newspaper and the drawing-room rang alike with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
venomous diatribes. Handel was called a swindler, a
drunkard, and a blasphemer, to whom Scripture even was
not sacred. The idea of setting Holy Writ to music
scandalised the Pharisees, who revelled in the licentious
operas and love-songs of the Italian school. All the small
wits of the time showered on Handel epigram and satire
unceasingly. The greatest of all the wits, however,
Alexander Pope, was his firm friend and admirer; and
in the &ldquo;Dunciad,&rdquo; wherein the wittiest of poets impaled
so many of the small fry of the age with his pungent and
vindictive shaft, he also slew some of the most malevolent
of Handel&rsquo;s foes.</p>

<p>Fielding, in <i>Tom Jones</i>, has an amusing hit at the
taste of the period&mdash;&ldquo;It was Mr. Western&rsquo;s custom every
afternoon, as soon as he was drunk, to hear his daughter
play on the harpsichord; for he was a great lover of music,
and perhaps, had he lived in town, might have passed as a
connoisseur, for he always excepted against the finest
compositions of Mr. Handel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So much had it become the fashion to criticise Handel&rsquo;s
new effects in vocal and instrumental composition, that
some years later Mr. Sheridan makes one of his characters
fire a pistol simply to shock the audience, and makes him
say in a stage whisper to the gallery, &ldquo;This hint, gentlemen,
I took from Handel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The composer&rsquo;s Oxford experience was rather amusing
and suggestive. We find it recorded that in July 1733,
&ldquo;one Handell, a foreigner, was desired to come to Oxford
to perform in music.&rdquo; Again the same writer says&mdash;&ldquo;Handell,
with his lousy crew, a great number of foreign
fiddlers, had a performance for his own benefit at the
theatre.&rdquo; One of the dons writes of the performance as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;This is an innovation; but everyone paid his
five shillings to try how a little fiddling would sit upon him.
And, notwithstanding the barbarous and inhuman combination
of such a parcel of unconscionable scamps, he
[Handel] disposed of the most of his tickets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Handel and his lousy crew,&rdquo; however, left Oxford with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
the prestige of a magnificent victory. His third oratorio,
&ldquo;Athaliah,&rdquo; was received with vast applause by a great
audience. Some of his university admirers, who appreciated
academic honours more than the musician did, urged him
to accept the degree of Doctor of Music, for which he
would have to pay a small fee. The characteristic reply
was a Parthian arrow: &ldquo;Vat te tevil I trow my money
away for dat vich the blockhead vish? I no vant!&rdquo;</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>In 1738 Handel was obliged to close the theatre and
suspend payment. He had made and spent during his
operatic career the sum of &pound;10,000 sterling, besides dissipating
the sum of &pound;50,000 subscribed by his noble
patrons. The rival house lasted but a few months longer,
and the Duchess of Marlborough and her friends, who
ruled the opposition clique and imported Bononcini, paid
&pound;12,000 for the pleasure of ruining Handel. His failure
as an operatic composer is due in part to the same causes
which constituted his success in oratorio and cantata. It
is a little significant to notice that, alike by the progress of
his own genius and by the force of conditions, he was
forced out of the operatic field at the very time when he
strove to tighten his grip on it.</p>

<p>His free introduction of choral and instrumental music,
his creation of new forms and remodelling of old ones, his
entire subordination of the words in the story to a pure
musical purpose, offended the singers and retarded the
action of the drama in the eyes of the audience; yet it was
by virtue of these unpopular characteristics that the public
mind was being moulded to understand and love the form
of the oratorio.</p>

<p>From 1734 to 1738 Handel composed and produced a
number of operatic works, the principal ones of which were
&ldquo;Alcina,&rdquo; 1735; &ldquo;Arminio,&rdquo; 1737; and &ldquo;Berenice,&rdquo; 1737.
He also during these years wrote the magnificent music to
Dryden&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alexander&rsquo;s Feast,&rdquo; and the great funeral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
anthem on the occasion of Queen Caroline&rsquo;s death in the
latter part of the year 1737.</p>

<p>We can hardly solve the tenacity of purpose with which
Handel persevered in the composition of operatic music
after it had ruined him; but it was still some time before
he fully appreciated the true turn of his genius, which
could not be trifled with or ignored. In his adversity he
had some consolation. His creditors were patient, believing
in his integrity. The royal family were his firm
friends.</p>

<p>Southey tells us that Handel, having asked the youthful
Prince of Wales, then a child, and afterward George the
Third, if he loved music, answered, when the prince expressed
his pleasure, &ldquo;A good boy, a good boy! You shall
protect my fame when I am dead.&rdquo; Afterwards, when the
half-imbecile George was crazed with family and public
misfortunes, he found his chief solace in the Waverley
novels and Handel&rsquo;s music.</p>

<p>It is also an interesting fact that the poets and thinkers
of the age were Handel&rsquo;s firm admirers. Such men as
Gay, Arbuthnot, Hughes, Colley Cibber, Pope, Fielding,
Hogarth, and Smollett, who recognised the deep, struggling
tendencies of the times, measured Handel truly. They
defended him in print, and never failed to attend his performances,
and at his benefit concerts their enthusiastic
support always insured him an overflowing house.</p>

<p>The popular instinct was also true to him. The aristocratic
classes sneered at his oratorios and complained at his
innovations. His music was found to be good bait for the
popular gardens and the holiday-makers of the period.
Jonathan Tyers was one of the most liberal managers of
this class. He was proprietor of Vauxhall Gardens, and
Handel (<i>incognito</i>) supplied him with nearly all his music.
The composer did much the same sort of thing for Marylebone
Gardens, furbishing up old and writing new strains
with an ease that well became the urgency of the
circumstances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My grandfather,&rdquo; says the Rev. J. Fountagne, &ldquo;as I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
have been told, was an enthusiast in music, and cultivated
most of all the friendship of musical men, especially of
Handel, who visited him often, and had a great predilection
for his society. This leads me to relate an anecdote which
I have on the best authority. While Marylebone Gardens
were flourishing, the enchanting music of Handel, and probably
of Arne, was often heard from the orchestra there.
One evening, as my grandfather and Handel were walking
together and alone, a new piece was struck up by the band.
&lsquo;Come, Mr. Fountagne,&rsquo; said Handel, &lsquo;let us sit down and
listen to this piece; I want to know your opinion about it.&rsquo;
Down they sat, and after some time the old parson, turning
to his companion, said, &lsquo;It is not worth listening to; it&rsquo;s
very poor stuff.&rsquo; &lsquo;You are right, Mr. Fountagne,&rsquo; said
Handel, &lsquo;it is very poor stuff; I thought so myself when
I had finished it.&rsquo; The old gentleman, being taken by surprise,
was beginning to apologise; but Handel assured him
there was no necessity, that the music was really bad, having
been composed hastily, and his time for the production
limited; and that the opinion given was as correct as it was
honest.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>The period of Handel&rsquo;s highest development had now
arrived. For seven years his genius had been slowly but
surely maturing, in obedience to the inner law of his being.
He had struggled long in the bonds of operatic composition,
but even here his innovations showed conclusively how he
was reaching out toward the form with which his name was
to be associated through all time. The year 1739 was one
of prodigious activity. The oratorio of &ldquo;Saul&rdquo; was produced,
of which the &ldquo;Dead March&rdquo; is still recognised as
one of the great musical compositions of all time, being one
of the few intensely solemn symphonies written in a major
key. Several works now forgotten were composed, and the
great &ldquo;Israel in Egypt&rdquo; was written in the incredibly
short space of twenty-seven days. Of this work a distinguished
writer on music says&mdash;&ldquo;Handel was now fifty-five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
years old, and had entered, after many a long and
weary contest, upon his last and greatest creative period.
His genius culminates in the &lsquo;Israel.&rsquo; Elsewhere he has
produced longer recitatives and more pathetic arias; nowhere
has he written finer tenor songs than &lsquo;The enemy
said,&rsquo; or finer duets than &lsquo;The Lord is a man of war;&rsquo;
and there is not in the history of music an example of
choruses piled up like so many Ossas on Pelions in such
majestic strength, and hurled in open defiance at a public
whose ears were itching for Italian love-lays and English
ballads. In these twenty-eight colossal choruses we perceive
at once a reaction against and a triumph over the
tastes of the age. The wonder is, not that the &lsquo;Israel&rsquo; was
unpopular, but that it should have been tolerated; but
Handel, while he appears to have been for years driven by
the public, had been, in reality, driving them. His earliest
oratorio, &lsquo;Il Trionfo del Tempo&rsquo; (composed in Italy), had
but two choruses; into his operas more and more were
introduced, with disastrous consequences; but when, at the
zenith of his strength, he produced a work which consisted
almost entirely of these unpopular peculiarities, the public
treated him with respect, and actually sat out three performances
in one season!&rdquo; In addition to these two great
oratorios, our composer produced the beautiful music to
Dryden&rsquo;s &ldquo;St. C&aelig;cilia Ode,&rdquo; and Milton&rsquo;s &ldquo;L&rsquo;Allegro&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Il Penseroso.&rdquo; Henceforth neither praise nor blame
could turn Handel from his appointed course. He was not
yet popular with the musical <i>dilettanti</i>, but we find no more
catering to an absurd taste, no more writing of silly
operatic froth.</p>

<p>Our composer had always been very fond of the Irish,
and, at the invitation of the lord-lieutenant and prominent
Dublin amateurs, he crossed the channel in 1741. He was
received with the greatest enthusiasm, and his house became
the resort of all the musical people in the city of Dublin.
One after another his principal works were produced before
admiring audiences in the new Music Hall in Fishamble
Street. The crush to hear the &ldquo;Allegro&rdquo; and &ldquo;Penseroso&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
at the opening performances was so great that the doors
had to be closed. The papers declared there never had
been seen such a scene before in Dublin.</p>

<p>Handel gave twelve performances at very short intervals,
comprising all of his finest works. In these concerts the
&ldquo;Acis and Galatea&rdquo; and &ldquo;Alexander&rsquo;s Feast&rdquo; were the
most admired; but the enthusiasm culminated in the
rendition of the &ldquo;Messiah,&rdquo; produced for the first time on
13th April 1742. The performance was a beneficiary one
in aid of poor and distressed prisoners for debt in the
Marshalsea in Dublin. So, by a remarkable coincidence,
the first performance of the &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; literally meant
deliverance to the captives. The principal singers were
Mrs. Cibber (daughter-in-law of Colley Cibber, and afterwards
one of the greatest actresses of her time), Mrs.
Avoglio, and Mr. Dubourg. The town was wild with excitement.
Critics, poets, fine ladies, and men of fashion
tore rhetoric to tatters in their admiration. A clergyman
so far forgot his Bible in his rapture as to exclaim to Mrs.
Cibber, at the close of one of her airs, &ldquo;Woman, for this be
all thy sins forgiven thee.&rdquo; The penny-a-liners wrote that
&ldquo;words were wanting to express the exquisite delight,&rdquo; etc.
And&mdash;supreme compliment of all, for Handel was a cynical
bachelor&mdash;the fine ladies consented to leave their hoops at
home for the second performance, that a couple of hundred
or so extra listeners might be accommodated. This event
was the grand triumph of Handel&rsquo;s life. Years of misconception,
neglect, and rivalry were swept out of mind in the
intoxicating delight of that night&rsquo;s success.</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>Handel returned to London, and composed a new
oratorio, &ldquo;Samson,&rdquo; for the following Lenten season. This,
together with the &ldquo;Messiah,&rdquo; heard for the first time in
London, made the stock of twelve performances. The
fashionable world ignored him altogether; the newspapers
kept a contemptuous silence; comic singers were hired to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
parody his noblest airs at the great houses; and impudent
Horace Walpole had the audacity to say that he &ldquo;had hired
all the goddesses from farces and singers of roast-beef, from
between the acts of both theatres, with a man with one note
in his voice, and a girl with never a one; and so they sang
and made brave hallelujahs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The new field into which Handel had entered inspired
his genius to its greatest energy. His new works for the
season of 1744 were the &ldquo;Dettingen Te Deum,&rdquo; &ldquo;Semele,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Joseph and his Brethren;&rdquo; for the next year (he had
again rented the Haymarket Theatre), &ldquo;Hercules,&rdquo; &ldquo;Belshazzar,&rdquo;
and a revival of &ldquo;Deborah.&rdquo; All these works
were produced in a style of then uncommon completeness;
and the great expense he incurred, combined with the
active hostility of the fashionable world, forced him to close
his doors and suspend payment. From this time forward
Handel gave concerts whenever he chose, and depended on
the people, who so supported him by their gradually growing
appreciation, that in two years he had paid off all his debts,
and in ten years had accumulated a fortune of &pound;10,000.
The works produced during these latter years were &ldquo;Judas
Maccab&aelig;us,&rdquo; 1747; &ldquo;Alexander,&rdquo; 1748; &ldquo;Joshua,&rdquo; 1748;
&ldquo;Susannah,&rdquo; 1749; &ldquo;Solomon,&rdquo; 1749; &ldquo;Theodora,&rdquo; 1750;
&ldquo;Choice of Hercules,&rdquo; 1751; &ldquo;Jephthah,&rdquo; 1752, closing
with this a stupendous series of dramatic oratorios. While
at work on the last, his eyes suffered an attack which finally
resulted in blindness.</p>

<p>Like Milton in the case of &ldquo;Paradise Lost,&rdquo; Handel preferred
one of his least popular oratorios, &ldquo;Theodora.&rdquo; It
was a great favourite with him, and he used to say that the
chorus, &ldquo;He saw the lovely youth,&rdquo; was finer than anything
in the &ldquo;Messiah.&rdquo; The public were not of this opinion,
and he was glad to give away tickets to any professors who
applied for them. When the &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; was again produced,
two of these gentlemen who had neglected &ldquo;Theodora&rdquo;
applied for admission. &ldquo;Oh! your sarvant, meine
Herren!&rdquo; exclaimed the indignant composer. &ldquo;You are
tamnable dainty! You would not go to &lsquo;Theodora&rsquo;&mdash;dere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
was room enough to dance dere when dat was perform.&rdquo;
When Handel heard that an enthusiast had offered to make
himself responsible for all the boxes the next time the
despised oratorio should be given&mdash;&ldquo;He is a fool,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;the Jews will not come to it as to &lsquo;Judas Maccab&aelig;us,&rsquo;
because it is a Christian story; and the ladies will not come,
because it is a virtuous one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Handel&rsquo;s triumph was now about to culminate in a serene
and acknowledged pre-eminence. The people had recognised
his greatness, and the reaction at last conquered all
classes. Publishers vied with each other in producing his
works, and their performance was greeted with great audiences
and enthusiastic applause. His last ten years were a
peaceful and beautiful ending of a stormy career.</p>


<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>Thought lingers pleasantly over this sunset period.
Handel throughout life was so wedded to his art, that he
cared nothing for the delights of woman&rsquo;s love. His recreations
were simple&mdash;rowing, walking, visiting his friends,
and playing on the organ. He would sometimes try to
play the people out of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, and hold them
indefinitely. He would resort at night to his favourite
tavern, the Queen&rsquo;s Head, where he would smoke and
drink beer with his chosen friends. Here he would indulge
in roaring conviviality and fun, and delight his friends with
sparkling satire and pungent humour, of which he was a
great master, helped by his amusing compound of English,
Italian, and German. Often he would visit the picture
galleries, of which he was passionately fond. His clumsy
but noble figure could be seen almost any morning rolling
through Charing Cross; and everyone who met old Father
Handel treated him with the deepest reverence.</p>

<p>The following graphic narrative, taken from the <i>Somerset
House Gazette</i>, offers a vivid portraiture. Sch&oelig;lcher, in
his <i>Life of Handel</i>, says that &ldquo;its author had a relative,
Zachary Hardcastle, a retired merchant, who was intimately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
acquainted with all the most distinguished men of his time,
artists, poets, musicians, and physicians.&rdquo; This old gentleman,
who lived at Paper Buildings, was accustomed to take
his morning walk in the garden of Somerset House, where
he happened to meet with another old man, Colley Cibber,
and proposed to him to go and hear a competition which
was to take place at midday for the post of organist to the
Temple, and he invited him to breakfast, telling him at the
same time that Dr. Pepusch and Dr. Arne were to be with
him at nine o&rsquo;clock. They go in; Pepusch arrives punctually
at the stroke of nine; presently there is a knock, the
door is opened, and Handel unexpectedly presents himself.
Then follows the scene:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Handel: &lsquo;Vat! mein dear friend Hardgasdle&mdash;vat!
you are merry py dimes! Vat! and Misder Golley Cibbers,
too! aye, and Togder Peepbush as vell! Vell, dat is gomigal.
Vell, mein friendts, andt how vags the vorldt wid you,
mein tdears? Bray, bray, do let me sit town a momend.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pepusch took the great man&rsquo;s hat, Colley Cibber took his
stick, and my great-uncle wheeled round his reading-chair,
which was somewhat about the dimensions of that in which
our kings and queens are crowned; and then the great man
sat him down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Vell, I thank you, gentlemen; now I am at mein ease
vonce more. Upon mein vord, dat is a picture of a ham.
It is very pold of me to gome to preak my fastd wid you
uninvided; and I have brought along wid me a nodable
abbetite; for the wader of old Fader Dems is it not a fine
pracer of the stomach?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You do me great honour, Mr. Handel,&rsquo; said my great-uncle.
&lsquo;I take this early visit as a great kindness.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A delightful morning for the water,&rsquo; said Colley
Cibber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pray, did you come with oars or scullers, Mr. Handel?&rsquo;
said Pepusch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, how gan you demand of me dat zilly question,
you who are a musician and a man of science, Togder
Peepbush? Vat gan it concern you whether I have one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
votdermans or two votdermans&mdash;whether I bull out mine
burce for to pay von shilling or two? Diavolo! I gannot
go here, or I gannot go dere, but some one shall send it to
some newsbaber, as how Misder Chorge Vrederick Handel
did go somedimes last week in a votderman&rsquo;s wherry, to
preak his fastd wid Misder Zac. Hardgasdle; but it shall be
all the fault wid himeself, if it shall be but in print, whether
I was rowed by one votdermans or by two votdermans.
So, Togder Peepbush, you will blease to excuse me from
dat.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Dr. Pepusch was for a moment disconcerted, but
it was soon forgotten in the first dish of coffee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, gentlemen,&rsquo; said my great-uncle Zachary, looking
at his tompion, &lsquo;it is ten minutes past nine. Shall we wait
more for Dr. Arne?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let us give him another five minutes&rsquo; chance, Master
Hardcastle,&rsquo; said Colley Cibber; &lsquo;he is too great a genius
to keep time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let us put it to the vote,&rsquo; said Dr. Pepusch, smiling.
&lsquo;Who holds up hands?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will segond your motion wid all mine heardt,&rsquo; said
Handel. &lsquo;I will hold up mine feeble hands for mine oldt
friendt Custos (Arne&rsquo;s name was Augustine), for I know not
who I wouldt waidt for, over andt above mine oldt rival,
Master Dom (meaning Pepusch). Only by your bermission,
I vill dake a snag of your ham, andt a slice of French roll,
or a modicum of chicken; for to dell you the honest fagd, I
am all pote famished, for I laid me down on mine billow in
bed the lastd nightd widout mine supper, at the instance of
mine physician, for which I am not altogeddere inglined to
extend mine fastd no longer.&rsquo; Then, laughing: &lsquo;Berhaps,
Mister Golley Cibbers, you may like to pote this to the
vote? But I shall not segond the motion, nor shall I holdt
up mine hand, as I will, by bermission, embloy it some
dime in a better office. So, if you please, do me the
kindness for to gut me a small slice of ham.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At this instant a hasty footstep was heard on the stairs,
accompanied by the humming of an air, all as gay as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
morning, which was beautiful and bright. It was the month
of May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bresto! be quick,&rsquo; said Handel; he knew it was Arne;
&lsquo;fifteen minutes of dime is butty well for an <i>ad libitum</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Arne,&rsquo; said my great-uncle&rsquo;s man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A chair was placed, and the social party commenced
their <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, and how do you find yourself, my dear sir?&rsquo;
inquired Arne, with friendly warmth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, by the mercy of Heaven, andt the waders of
Aix-la-Chapelle, andt the addentions of mine togders andt
physicians, and oggulists, of lade years, under Providence, I
am surbrizingly pedder&mdash;thank you kindly, Misder Custos.
Andt you have also been doing well of lade, as I am bleased
to hear. You see, sir,&rsquo; pointing to his plate, &lsquo;you see, sir,
dat I am in the way for to regruit mine flesh wid the good
viands of Misder Zachary Hardgasdle.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So, sir, I presume you are come to witness the trial
of skill at the old round church? I understand the
amateurs expect a pretty sharp contest,&rsquo; said Arne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gondest,&rsquo; echoed Handel, laying down his knife and
fork. &lsquo;Yes, no doubt; your amadeurs have a bassion for
gondest. Not vot it vos in our remembrance. Hey, mine
friendt? Ha, ha, ha!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, sir, I am happy to say those days of envy and
bickering, and party feeling, are gone and past. To be sure
we had enough of such disgraceful warfare: it lasted too
long.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, yes; it tid last too long, it bereft me of mine
poor limbs: it tid bereave of that vot is the most blessed
gift of Him vot made us, andt not wee ourselves. And for
vot? Vy, for noding in the vorldt pode the bleasure and
bastime of them who, having no widt, nor no want, set at
loggerheads such men as live by their widts, to worry and
destroy one andt anodere as wild beasts in the Golloseum in
the dimes of the Romans.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Dr. Pepusch during this conversation, as my great-uncle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
observed, was sitting on thorns; he was in the
confederacy professionally only.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I hope, sir,&rsquo; observed the doctor, &lsquo;you do not include
me among those who did injustice to your talents?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nod at all, nod at all; God forbid! I am a great
admirer of the airs of the &ldquo;Peggar&rsquo;s Obera,&rdquo; andt every
professional gendtleman must do his best for to live.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This mild return, couched under an apparent compliment,
was well received; but Handel, who had a talent for
sarcastic drolling, added&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pute why blay the Peggar yourself, Togder, andt adapt
oldt pallad humsdrum, ven, as a man of science, you could
gombose original airs of your own? Here is mine friendt,
Custos Arne, who has made a road for himself, for to drive
along his own genius to the demple of fame.&rsquo; Then, turning
to our illustrious Arne, he continued, &lsquo;Min friendt Custos,
you and I must meed togeder somedimes before it is long,
and hold a <i>t&ecirc;de-&agrave;-t&ecirc;de</i> of old days vat is gone; ha, ha! Oh!
it is gomigal now dat id is all gone by. Custos, to nod you
remember as it was almost only of yesterday dat she-devil
Guzzoni, andt dat other brecious taughter of iniquity,
Pelzebub&rsquo;s spoiled child, the bretty-faced Faustina? Oh!
the mad rage vot I have to answer for, vot with one and the
oder of these fine latdies&rsquo; airs andt graces. Again, to you
nod remember dat ubstardt buppy Senesino, and the goxgomb
Farinelli? Next, again, mine somedimes nodtable
rival Bononcini, and old Borbora? Ha, ha, ha! all at war
wid me, andt all at war wid themselves. Such a gonfusion
of rivalshibs, andt double-facedness, andt hybocrisy, and
malice, vot would make a gomigal subject for a boem in
rhymes, or a biece for the stage, as I hopes to be saved.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>


<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>We now turn from the man to his music. In his daily
life with the world we get a spectacle of a quick, passionate
temper, incased in a great burly frame, and raging into
whirlwinds of excitement at small provocation; a gourmand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
devoted to the pleasure of the table, sometimes indeed
gratifying his appetite in no seemly fashion, resembling his
friend Dr. Samuel Johnson in many notable ways. Handel
as a man was of the earth, earthly, in the extreme, and
marked by many whimsical and disagreeable faults. But in
his art we recognise a genius so colossal, massive, and self-poised
as to raise admiration to its superlative of awe.
When Handel had disencumbered himself of tradition, convention,
the trappings of time and circumstances, he attained
a place in musical creation, solitary and unique. His genius
found expression in forms large and austere, disdaining the
luxuriant and trivial. He embodied the spirit of Protestantism
in music; and a recognition of this fact is probably the
key of the admiration felt for him by the Anglo-Saxon races.</p>

<p>Handel possessed an inexhaustible fund of melody of
the noblest order; an almost unequalled command of
musical expression; perfect power over all the resources of
his science; the faculty of wielding huge masses of tone
with perfect ease and felicity; and he was without rival in
the sublimity of ideas. The problem which he so successfully
solved in the oratorio was that of giving such dramatic
force to the music, in which he clothed the sacred texts, as
to be able to dispense with all scenic and stage effects. One
of the finest operatic composers of the time, the rival of
Bach as an instrumental composer, and performer on the
harpsichord or organ, the unanimous verdict of the musical
world is that no one has ever equalled him in completeness,
range of effect, elevation and variety of conception, and
sublimity in the treatment of sacred music. We can readily
appreciate Handel&rsquo;s own words when describing his own
sensations in writing the &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did think I did
see all heaven before me, and the great God himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The great man died on Good Friday night, 1759, aged
seventy-five years. He had often wished &ldquo;he might breathe
his last on Good Friday, in hope,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of meeting his
good God, his sweet Lord and Saviour, on the day of his
resurrection.&rdquo; The old blind musician had his wish.</p>

<h2><a name="gluck" id="gluck"></a><i>GLUCK.</i></h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Gluck</span> is a noble and striking figure in musical history,
alike in the services he rendered to his art and the dignity
and strength of his personal character. As the predecessor
of Wagner and Meyerbeer, who among the composers of
this century have given opera its largest and noblest expression,
he anticipated their important reforms, and in his
musical creations we see all that is best in what is called the
new school.</p>

<p>The man, the Ritter <span class="smcap">Christoph Wilibald von Gluck</span>,
is almost as interesting to us as the musician. He moved
in the society of princes with a calm and haughty dignity,
their conscious peer, and never prostituted his art to gain
personal advancement or to curry favour with the great ones
of the earth. He possessed a majesty of nature which was
the combined effect of personal pride, a certain lofty self-reliance,
and a deep conviction that he was the apostle of
an important musical mission.</p>

<p>Gluck&rsquo;s whole life was illumined by an indomitable sense
of his own strength, and lifted by it into an atmosphere high
above that of his rivals, whom the world has now almost
forgotten, except as they were immortalised by being his
enemies. Like Milton and Bacon, who put on record their
knowledge that they had written for all time, Gluck had a
magnificent consciousness of himself. &ldquo;I have written,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;the music of my &lsquo;Armida&rsquo; in such a manner as to
prevent its soon growing old.&rdquo; This is a sublime vanity
inseparable from the great aggressive geniuses of the world,
the wind of the speed which measures their force of impact.</p>

<p>Duplessis&rsquo;s portrait of Gluck almost takes the man out of
paint to put him in flesh and blood. He looks down with
wide-open eyes, swelling nostrils, firm mouth, and massive
chin. The noble brow, dome-like and expanded, relieves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
the massiveness of his face; and the whole countenance and
figure express the repose of a powerful and passionate nature
schooled into balance and symmetry: altogether the
presentment of a great man, who felt that he could move the
world and had found the <i>pou sto</i>. Of a large and robust
type of physical beauty, Nature seems to have endowed him
on every hand with splendid gifts. Such a man as this could
say with calm simplicity to Marie Antoinette, who inquired
one night about his new opera of &ldquo;Armida,&rdquo; then nearly
finished&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Madame, il est bient&ocirc;t fini, et vraiment ce sera
superbe.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>One night Handel listened to a new opera from a young
and unknown composer, the &ldquo;Caduta de&rsquo; Giganti,&rdquo; one of
Gluck&rsquo;s very earliest works, written when he was yet corrupted
with all the vices of the Italian method. &ldquo;Mein Gott! he
is an idiot,&rdquo; said Handel; &ldquo;he knows no more of counterpoint
then mein cook.&rdquo; Handel did not see with prophetic
eyes. He never met Gluck afterwards, and we do not know
his later opinion of the composer of &ldquo;Orpheus and
Eurydice&rdquo; and &ldquo;Iphigenia in Tauris.&rdquo; But Gluck had ever
the profoundest admiration for the author of the &ldquo;Messiah.&rdquo;
There was something in these two strikingly similar, as their
music was alike characterised by massive simplicity and
strength, not rough-hewn, but shaped into austere beauty.</p>

<p>Before we relate the great episode of our composer&rsquo;s life,
let us take a backward glance at his youth. He was the son
of a forester in the service of Prince Lobkowitz, born at
Weidenwang in the Upper Palatinate, 2nd July 1714.
Gluck was devoted to music from early childhood, but
received, in connection with the musical art, an excellent
education at the Jesuit College of Kommotau. Here he
learned singing, the organ, the violin and harpsichord, and
had a mind to get his living by devoting his musical talents
to the Church. The Prague public recognised in him a
musician of fair talent, but he found but little encouragement
to stay at the Bohemian capital. So he decided to finish
his musical education at Vienna, where more distinguished
masters could be had. Prince Lobkowitz, who remembered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
his gamekeeper&rsquo;s son, introduced the young man to the
Italian Prince Melzi, who induced him to accompany him
to Milan. As the pupil of the Italian organist and composer,
Sammartini, he made rapid progress in operatic composition.
He was successful in pleasing Italian audiences, and in four
years produced eight operas, for which the world has forgiven
him in forgetting them. Then Gluck must go to London to
see what impression he could make on English critics; for
London then, as now, was one of the great musical centres,
where every successful composer or singer must get his
brevet.</p>

<p>Gluck&rsquo;s failure to please in London was, perhaps, an
important epoch in his career. With a mind singularly
sensitive to new impressions, and already struggling with
fresh ideas in the laws of operatic composition, Handel&rsquo;s
great music must have had a powerful effect in stimulating
his unconscious progress. His last production in England,
&ldquo;Pyramus and Thisbe,&rdquo; was a <i>pasticcio</i> opera, in which he
embodied the best bits out of his previous works. The
experiment was a glaring failure, as it ought to have been;
for it illustrated the Italian method, which was designed for
mere vocal display, carried to its logical absurdity.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>In 1748 Gluck settled in Vienna, where almost immediately
his opera of &ldquo;Semiramide&rdquo; was produced. Here
he conceived a passion for Marianne, the daughter of Joseph
Pergin, a rich banker; but on account of the father&rsquo;s distaste
for a musical son-in-law, the marriage did not occur
till 1750. &ldquo;Telemacco&rdquo; and &ldquo;Clemenza di Tito&rdquo; were
composed about this time, and performed in Vienna, Rome,
and Naples. In 1755 our composer received the order of
the Golden Spur from the Roman pontiff in recognition of
the merits of two operas performed at Rome, called &ldquo;Il
Trionfo di Camillo&rdquo; and &ldquo;Antigono.&rdquo; Seven years were
now actively employed in producing operas for Vienna and
Italian cities, which, without possessing great value, show
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
the change which had begun to take place in this composer&rsquo;s
theories of dramatic music. In Paris he had been
struck with the operas of Rameau, in which the declamatory
form was strongly marked. His early Italian training had
fixed in his mind the importance of pure melody. From
Germany he obtained his appreciation of harmony, and had
made a deep study of the uses of the orchestra. So we see
this great reformer struggling on with many faltering steps
towards that result which he afterwards summed up in the
following concise description&mdash;&ldquo;My purpose was to restrict
music to its true office, that of ministering to the expression
of poetry, without interrupting the action.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Calzabigi Gluck had met an author who fully
appreciated his ideas, and had the talent of writing a
libretto in accordance with them. This coadjutor wrote all
the librettos that belonged to Gluck&rsquo;s greatest period. He
had produced his &ldquo;Orpheus and Eurydice&rdquo; and &ldquo;Alceste&rdquo;
in Vienna with a fair amount of success; but his tastes
drew him strongly to the French stage, where the art of
acting and declamation was cultivated then, as it is now, to
a height unknown in other parts of Europe. So we find
him gladly accepting an offer from the managers of the
French Opera to migrate to the great city, in which were
fermenting with much noisy fervour those new ideas in art,
literature, politics, and society, which were turning the eyes
of all Europe to the French capital.</p>

<p>The world&rsquo;s history has hardly a more picturesque and
striking spectacle, a period more fraught with the working
of powerful forces, than that exhibited by French society in
the latter part of Louis XV.&rsquo;s reign. We see a court rotten
to the core with indulgence in every form of sensuality and
vice, yet glittering with the veneer of a social polish which
made it the admiration of the world. A dissolute king was
ruled by a succession of mistresses, and all the courtiers
vied in emulating the vice and extravagance of their master.
Yet in this foul compost-heap art and literature flourished
with a tropical luxuriance. Voltaire was at the height of
his splendid career, the most brilliant wit and philosopher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
of his age. The lightnings of his mockery attacked with an
incessant play the social, political, and religious shams of
the period. People of all classes, under the influence of
his unsparing satire, were learning to see with clear eyes
what an utterly artificial and polluted age they lived in, and
the cement which bound society in a compact whole was
fast melting under this powerful solvent.</p>

<p>Rousseau, with his romantic philosophy and eloquence,
had planted his new ideas deep in the hearts of his contemporaries,
weary with the artifice and the corruption of a
time which had exhausted itself and had nothing to promise
under the old social <i>r&eacute;gime</i>. The ideals uplifted in the
<i>Nouvelle H&eacute;lo&iuml;se</i> and the <i>Confessions</i> awakened men&rsquo;s
minds with a great rebound to the charms of Nature,
simplicity, and a social order untrammelled by rules or conventions.
The eloquence with which these theories were
propounded carried the French people by storm, and
Rousseau was a demigod at whose shrine worshipped alike
duchess and peasant. The Encyclop&aelig;dists stimulated the
ferment by their literary enthusiasm, and the heartiness
with which they co-operated with the whole current of
revolutionary thought.</p>

<p>The very atmosphere was reeking with the prophecy of
imminent change. Versailles itself did not escape the
contagion. Courtiers and aristocrats, in worshipping the
beautiful ideals set up by the new school, which were as far
removed as possible from their own effete civilisation, did
not realise that they were playing with the fire which was to
burn out the whole social edifice of France with such a
terrible conflagration; for, back and beneath all this, there
was a people groaning under long centuries of accumulated
wrong, in whose imbruted hearts the theories applauded by
their oppressors with a sort of <i>doctrinaire</i> delight were
working with a fatal fever.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span></p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>In this strange condition of affairs Gluck found his
new sphere of labour&mdash;Gluck, himself overflowing with the
revolutionary spirit, full of the enthusiasm of reform. At
first he carried everything before him. Protected by
royalty, he produced, on the basis of an admirable libretto
by Du Rollet, one of the great wits of the time, &ldquo;Iphigenia
in Aulis.&rdquo; It was enthusiastically received. The critics,
delighted to establish the reputation of one especially
favoured by the Dauphiness Marie Antoinette, exhausted
superlatives on the new opera. The Abb&eacute; Arnaud, one of
the leading <i>dilettanti</i>, exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;With such music one
might found a new religion!&rdquo; To be sure, the connoisseurs
could not understand the complexities of the music; but,
following the rule of all connoisseurs before or since, they
considered it all the more learned and profound. So led,
the general public clapped their hands, and agreed to
consider Gluck as a great composer. He was called the
Hercules of music; the opera-house was crammed night after
night; his footsteps were dogged in the streets by admiring
enthusiasts; the wits and poets occupied themselves with
composing sonnets in his praise; brilliant courtiers and fine
ladies showered valuable gifts on the new musical oracle;
he was hailed as the exponent of Rousseauism in music.
We read that it was considered to be a priceless privilege to
be admitted to the rehearsal of a new opera, to see Gluck
conduct in nightcap and dressing-gown.</p>

<p>Fresh adaptations of &ldquo;Orpheus and Eurydice&rdquo; and of
&ldquo;Alceste&rdquo; were produced. The first, brought out in 1784,
was received with an enthusiasm which could be contented
only with forty-nine consecutive performances. The second
act of this work has been called one of the most astonishing
productions of the human mind. The public began to show
signs of fickleness, however, on the production of the
&ldquo;Alceste.&rdquo; On the first night a murmur arose among the
spectators&mdash;&ldquo;The piece has fallen.&rdquo; Abb&eacute; Arnaud, Gluck&rsquo;s
devoted defender, arose in his box and replied, &ldquo;Yes!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
fallen from heaven.&rdquo; While Mademoiselle Levasseur was
singing one of the great airs, a voice was heard to say,
&ldquo;Ah! you tear out my ears;&rdquo; to which the caustic
rejoinder was, &ldquo;How fortunate, if it is to give you others!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gluck himself was badly bitten, in spite of his hatred
of shams and shallowness, with the pretences of the time,
which professed to dote on nature and simplicity. In a
letter to his old pupil, Marie Antoinette, wherein he
disclaims any pretension of teaching the French a new
school of music, he says&mdash;&ldquo;I see with satisfaction that
the language of Nature is the universal language.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, here on the crumbling crust of a volcano, where the
volatile French court danced and fiddled and sang,
unreckoning of what was soon to come, our composer and
his admirers patted each other on the back with infinite
complacency.</p>

<p>But after this high tide of prosperity there was to come a
reverse. A powerful faction, that for a time had been
crushed by Gluck&rsquo;s triumph, after a while raised their heads
and organised an attack. There were second-rate composers
whose scores had been laid on the shelf in the rage
for the new favourite; musicians who were shocked and
enraged at the difficulties of his instrumentation; wits who,
having praised Gluck for a while, thought they could now
find a readier field for their quills in satire; and a large
section of the public who changed for no earthly reason but
that they got tired of doing one thing.</p>

<p>Therefore, the Italian Piccini was imported to be pitted
against the reigning deity. The French court was broken
up into hostile ranks. Marie Antoinette was Gluck&rsquo;s
patron, but Madame Du Barry, the king&rsquo;s mistress, declared
for Piccini. Abb&eacute; Arnaud fought for Gluck; but the witty
Marmontel was the advocate of his rival. The keen-witted
Du Rollet was Gluckist; but La Harpe, the eloquent, was
Piccinist. So this battle-royal in art commenced and raged
with virulence. The green-room was made unmusical with
contentions carried out in polite Billingsgate. Gluck tore
up his unfinished score in rage when he learned that his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
rival was to compose an opera on the same libretto. La
Harpe said&mdash;&ldquo;The famous Gluck may puff his own compositions,
but he can&rsquo;t prevent them from boring us to
death.&rdquo; Thus the wags of Paris laughed and wrangled over
the musical rivals. Berton, the new director, fancied he
could soften the dispute and make the two composers
friends; so at a dinner-party, when they were all in their
cups, he proposed that they should compose an opera
jointly. This was demurred to; but it was finally arranged
that they should compose an opera on the same subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Iphigenia in Tauris,&rdquo; Gluck&rsquo;s second &ldquo;Iphigenia,&rdquo; produced
in 1779, was such a masterpiece that his rival shut
his own score in his portfolio, and kept it two years.
All Paris was enraptured with this great work, and Gluck&rsquo;s
detractors were silenced in the wave of enthusiasm which
swept the public. Abb&eacute; Arnaud&rsquo;s opinion was the echo of
the general mind&mdash;&ldquo;There was but one beautiful part, and
that was the whole of it.&rdquo; This opera may be regarded as
the most perfect example of Gluck&rsquo;s school in making the
music the full reflex of the dramatic action. While Orestes
sings in the opera, &ldquo;My heart is calm,&rdquo; the orchestra
continues to paint the agitation of his thoughts. During
the rehearsal the musician failed to understand the exigency
and ceased playing. The composer cried out, in a rage,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see he is lying? Go on, go on; he has just
killed his mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On one occasion, when he was praising Rameau&rsquo;s chorus
of &ldquo;Castor and Pollux,&rdquo; an admirer of his flattered him with
the remark, &ldquo;But what a difference between this chorus and
that of your &lsquo;Iphigenia!&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;Yet it is very well done,&rdquo;
said Gluck; &ldquo;one is only a religious ceremony, the other is
a real funeral.&rdquo; He was wont to say that in composing he
always tried to forget he was a musician.</p>

<p>Gluck, however, a few months subsequent to this, was
so much humiliated at the non-success of &ldquo;Echo and Narcissus,&rdquo;
that he left Paris in bitter irritation, in spite of
Marie Antoinette&rsquo;s pleadings that he should remain at the
French capital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
The composer was now advanced in years, and had
become impatient and fretful. He left Paris for Vienna in
1780, having amassed considerable property. There, as an
old, broken-down man, he listened to the young Mozart&rsquo;s
new symphonies and operas, and applauded them with great
zeal: for Gluck, though fiery and haughty in the extreme,
was singularly generous in recognising the merits of others.</p>

<p>This was exhibited in Paris in his treatment of M&eacute;hul,
the Belgian composer, then a youth of sixteen, who had just
arrived in the gay city. It was on the eve of the first
representation of &ldquo;Iphigenia in Tauris,&rdquo; when the operatic
battle was agitating the public. With all the ardour of a
novice and a devotee, the young musical student immediately
threw himself into the affray, and by the aid of a
friend he succeeded in gaining admittance to the theatre
for the final rehearsal of Gluck&rsquo;s opera. This so enchanted
him that he resolved to be present at the public performance.
But, unluckily for the resolve, he had no money, and no
prospect of obtaining any; so, with a determination and a
love for art which deserve to be remembered, he decided to
hide himself in one of the boxes and there to wait for the
time of representation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the end of the rehearsal,&rdquo; writes George Hogarth in
his <i>Memoirs of the Drama</i>, &ldquo;he was discovered in his
place of concealment by the servants of the theatre, who
proceeded to turn him out very roughly. Gluck, who had
not left the house, heard the noise, came to the spot, and
found the young man, whose spirit was roused, resisting the
indignity with which he was treated. M&eacute;hul, finding in
whose presence he was, was ready to sink with confusion;
but, in answer to Gluck&rsquo;s questions, he told him that he
was a young musical student from the country, whose
anxiety to be present at the performance of the opera had
led him into the commission of an impropriety. Gluck, as
may be supposed, was delighted with a piece of enthusiasm
so flattering to himself, and not only gave his young admirer
a ticket of admission, but desired his acquaintance.&rdquo; From
this artistic <i>contretemps</i>, then, arose a friendship alike
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
creditable to the goodness and generosity of Gluck, as it was
to the sincerity and high order of M&eacute;hul&rsquo;s musical talent.</p>

<p>Gluck&rsquo;s death, in 1787, was caused by over-indulgence in
wine at a dinner which he gave to some of his friends.
The love of stimulants had grown upon him in his old age,
and had become almost a passion. An enforced abstinence
of some months was succeeded by a debauch, in which he
drank an immense quantity of brandy. The effects brought
on a fit of apoplexy, of which he died, aged seventy-three.</p>

<p>Gluck&rsquo;s place in musical history is peculiar and well
marked. He entered the field of operatic composition when
it was hampered with a great variety of dry forms, and
utterly without soul and poetic spirit. The object of
composers seemed to be to show mere contrapuntal
learning, or to furnish singers opportunity to display vocal
agility. The opera, as a large and symmetrical expression
of human emotions, suggested in the collisions of a dramatic
story, was utterly an unknown quantity in art. Gluck&rsquo;s
attention was early called to this radical inconsistency; and,
though he did not learn for many years to develop his
musical ideas according to a theory, and never carried that
theory to the logical results insisted on by his great after-type,
Wagner, he accomplished much in the way of sweeping
reform. He elaborated the recitative or declamatory
element in opera with great care, and insisted that his
singers should make this the object of their most careful
efforts. The arias, duos, quartets, etc., as well as the
choruses and orchestral parts, were made consistent with
the dramatic motive and situations. In a word, Gluck
aimed with a single-hearted purpose to make music the
expression of poetry and sentiment.</p>

<p>The principles of Gluck&rsquo;s school of operatic writing may
be briefly summarised as follows:&mdash;That dramatic music
can only reach its highest power and beauty when joined to
a simple and poetic text, expressing passions true to Nature;
that music can be made the language of all the varied
emotions of the heart; that the music of an opera must
exactly follow the rhythm and melody of the words; that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
the orchestra must be only used to strengthen and intensify
the feeling embodied in the vocal parts, as demanded by
the text or dramatic situation. We get some further light
on these principles from Gluck&rsquo;s letter of dedication to the
Grand-Duke of Tuscany on the publication of &ldquo;Alceste.&rdquo;
He writes:&mdash;&ldquo;I am of opinion that music must be to poetry
what liveliness of colour and a happy mixture of light and
shade are for a faultless and well-arranged drawing, which
serve to add life to the figures without injuring the outlines;
... that the overture should prepare the auditors for the
character of the action which is to be presented, and hint at
the progress of the same; that the instruments must be
employed according to the degree of interest and passion;
that the composer should avoid too marked a disparity in
the dialogue between the air and recitative, in order not to
break the sense of a period, or interrupt the energy of the
action.... Finally, I have even felt compelled to sacrifice
rules to the improvement of the effect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We find in this composer&rsquo;s music, therefore, a largeness
and dignity of treatment which have never been surpassed.
His command of melody is quite remarkable, but his use of
it is under severe artistic restraint; for it is always characterised
by breadth, simplicity, and directness. He aimed at
and attained the symmetrical balance of an old Greek play.</p>

<h2><a name="haydn" id="haydn"></a><i>HAYDN.</i></h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Papa Haydn!</span>&rdquo; Thus did Mozart ever speak of his
foster-father in music, and the title, transmitted to posterity,
admirably expressed the sweet, placid, gentle nature, whose
possessor was personally beloved no less than he was
admired. His life flowed, broad and unruffled, like some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
great river, unvexed for the most part by the rivalries,
jealousies, and sufferings, oftentimes self-inflicted, which
have harassed the careers of other great musicians. He
remained to the last the favourite of the imperial court of
Vienna, and princes followed his remains to their last
resting-place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Haydn</span> was the eldest of the twenty children of
Matthias Haydn, a wheelwright at Rohrau, Lower Austria,
where he was born in 1732. At the age of twelve years he
was engaged to sing in Vienna. He became a chorister in
St. Stephen&rsquo;s Church, but offended the choir-master by the
revolt on the part of himself and parents from submitting to
the usual means then taken to perpetuate a fine soprano in
boys. So Haydn, who had surreptitiously picked up a good
deal of musical knowledge apart from the art of singing, was
at the age of sixteen turned out on the world. A compassionate
barber, however, took him in, and Haydn dressed
and powdered wigs downstairs, while he worked away at a
little worm-eaten harpsichord at night in his room. Unfortunate
boy! he managed to get himself engaged to the
barber&rsquo;s daughter, Anne Keller, who was for a good while
the Xantippe of his gentle life, and he paid dearly for his
father-in-law&rsquo;s early hospitality.</p>

<p>The young musician soon began to be known, as he
played the violin in one church, the organ in another, and
got some pupils. His first rise was his acquaintance with
Metastasio, the poet-laureate of the court. Through him
Haydn got introduced to the mistress of the Venetian
ambassador, a great musical enthusiast, and in her circle
he met Porpora, the best music-master in the world, but a
crusty, snarling old man. Porpora held at Vienna the
position of musical dictator and censor, and he exercised
the tyrannical privileges of his post mercilessly. Haydn was
a small, dark-complexioned, insignificant-looking youth, and
Porpora, of course, snubbed him most contemptuously.
But Haydn wanted instruction, and no one in the world
could give it so well as the savage old <i>maestro</i>. So he
performed all sorts of menial services for him, cleaned his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
shoes, powdered his wig, and ran all his errands. The
result was that Porpora softened and consented to give his
young admirer lessons&mdash;no great hardship, for young Haydn
proved a most apt and gifted pupil. And it was not long
either before the young musician&rsquo;s compositions attracted
public attention and found a sale. The very curious relations
between Haydn and Porpora are brilliantly sketched
in George Sand&rsquo;s <i>Consuelo</i>.</p>

<p>At night Haydn, accompanied by his friends, was wont
to wander about Vienna by moonlight, and serenade his
patrons with trios and quartets of his own composition. He
happened one night to stop under the window of Bernardone
Kurz, a director of a theatre and the leading clown
of Vienna. Down rushed Kurz very excitedly. &ldquo;Who are
you?&rdquo; he shrieked. &ldquo;Joseph Haydn.&rdquo; &ldquo;Whose music is
it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mine.&rdquo; &ldquo;The deuce it is! And at your age,
too!&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, I must begin with something.&rdquo; &ldquo;Come
along upstairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The enthusiastic director collared his prize, and was soon
deep in explaining a wonderful libretto, entitled &ldquo;The
Devil on Two Sticks.&rdquo; To write music for this was no easy
matter; for it was to represent all sorts of absurd things,
among others a tempest. The tempest made Haydn
despair, and he sat at the piano, banging away in a reckless
fashion, while the director stood behind him, raving in a
disconnected way as to his meaning. At last the distracted
pianist brought his fists simultaneously down upon the
key-board, and made a rapid sweep of all the notes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bravo! bravo! that is the tempest!&rdquo; cried Kurz.</p>

<p>The buffoon also laid himself on a chair, and had it
carried about the room, during which he threw out his
limbs in imitation of the act of swimming. Haydn supplied
an accompaniment so suitable that Kurz soon landed on
<i>terra firma</i>, and congratulated the composer, assuring him
that he was the man to compose the opera. By this stroke
of good luck our young musician received one hundred and
thirty florins.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span></p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>At the age of twenty-eight Haydn composed his first
symphony. Soon after this he attracted the attention of the
old Prince Esterhazy, all the members of whose family have
become known in the history of music as generous M&aelig;cenases
of the art.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! you don&rsquo;t mean to say that little blackamoor&rdquo;
(alluding to Haydn&rsquo;s brown complexion and small stature)
&ldquo;composed that symphony?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely, prince,&rdquo; replied the director Friedburg, beckoning
to Joseph Haydn, who advanced towards the orchestra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little Moor,&rdquo; says the old gentleman, &ldquo;you shall enter
my service. I am Prince Esterhazy. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haydn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I&rsquo;ve heard of you. Get along and dress yourself
like a <i>Kapellmeister</i>. Clap on a new coat, and mind your
wig is curled. You&rsquo;re too short. You shall have red heels;
but they shall be high, that your stature may correspond
with your merit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he went to live at Eisenstadt in the Esterhazy household,
and received a salary of four hundred florins, which
was afterwards raised to one thousand by Prince Nicholas
Esterhazy. Haydn continued the intimate friend and associate
of Prince Nicholas for thirty years, and death only
dissolved the bond between them. In the Esterhazy household
the life of Haydn was a very quiet one, a life of incessant
and happy industry; for he poured out an incredible number
of works, among them not a few of his most famous ones.
So he spent a happy life in hard labour, alternated with
delightful recreations at the Esterhazy country-seat, mountain
rambles, hunting and fishing, open-air concerts, musical
evenings, etc.</p>

<p>A French traveller who visited Esterhazy about 1782 says&mdash;&ldquo;The
ch&acirc;teau stands quite solitary, and the prince sees
nobody but his officials and servants, and strangers who
come hither from curiosity. He has a puppet-theatre, which
is certainly unique in character. Here the grandest operas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
are produced. One knows not whether to be amazed or to
laugh at seeing &lsquo;Alceste,&rsquo; &lsquo;Alcides,&rsquo; etc., put on the stage
with all due solemnity and played by puppets. His orchestra
is one of the best I ever heard, and the great Haydn is his
court and theatre composer. He employs a poet for his
singular theatre, whose humour and skill in suiting the
grandest subjects for the stage, and in parodying the gravest
effects, are often exceedingly happy. He often engages a
troupe of wandering players for months at a time, and he
himself and his retinue form the entire audience. They are
allowed to come on the stage uncombed, drunk, their parts
not half learned, and half dressed. The prince is not for
the serious and tragic, and he enjoys it when the players, like
Sancho Panza, give loose reins to their humour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet Haydn was not perfectly contented. He would have
been had it not been for his terrible wife, the hair-dresser&rsquo;s
daughter, who had a dismal, mischievous, sullen nature, a
venomous tongue, and a savage temper. She kept Haydn
in hot water continually, till at last he broke loose from this
plague by separating from her. Scandal says that Haydn,
who had a very affectionate and sympathetic nature, found
ample consolation for marital infelicity in the charms and
society of the lovely Boselli, a great singer. He had her
picture painted, and humoured all her whims and caprices,
to the sore depletion of his pocket.</p>

<p>In after-years again he was mixed up in a little affair with
the great Mrs. Billington, whose beautiful person was no less
marked than her fine voice. Sir Joshua Reynolds was
painting her portrait for him, and had represented her as
St. Cecilia listening to celestial music. Haydn paid her a
charming compliment at one of the sittings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think of the charming Billington&rsquo;s picture?&rdquo;
said Sir Joshua.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Haydn, &ldquo;it is indeed a beautiful picture. It
is just like her, but there&rsquo;s a strange mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you have painted her listening to the angels, when
you ought to have painted the angels listening to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
At one time, during Haydn&rsquo;s connection with Prince
Esterhazy, the latter, from motives of economy, determined
to dismiss his celebrated orchestra, which he supported at
great expense. Haydn was the leader, and his patron&rsquo;s
purpose caused him sore pain, as indeed it did all the
players, among whom were many distinguished instrumentalists.
Still, there was nothing to be done but for all
concerned to make themselves as cheerful as possible under
the circumstances; so, with that fund of wit and humour
which seems to have been concealed under the immaculate
coat and formal wig of the strait-laced Haydn, he set about
composing a work for the last performance of the royal band,
a work which has ever since borne the appropriate title of
the &ldquo;Farewell Symphony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the night appointed for the last performance a
brilliant company, including the prince, had assembled.
The music of the new symphony began gaily enough&mdash;it
was even merry. As it went on, however, it became soft
and dreamy. The strains were sad and &ldquo;long drawn out.&rdquo;
At length a sorrowful wailing began. One instrument
after another left off, and each musician, as his task ended,
blew out his lamp and departed with his music rolled up
under his arm.</p>

<p>Haydn was the last to finish, save one, and this was the
prince&rsquo;s favourite violinist, who said all that he had to say
in a brilliant violin cadenza, when, behold! he made off.</p>

<p>The prince was astonished. &ldquo;What is the meaning of
all this?&rdquo; cried he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is our sorrowful farewell,&rdquo; answered Haydn.</p>

<p>This was too much. The prince was overcome, and, with
a good laugh, said: &ldquo;Well, I think I must reconsider my
decision. At any rate we will not say &lsquo;good-bye&rsquo; now.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>During the thirty years of Haydn&rsquo;s quiet life with the
Esterhazys he had been gradually acquiring an immense
reputation in France, England and Spain, of which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
himself was unconscious. His great symphonies had
stamped him world-wide as a composer of remarkable
creative genius. Haydn&rsquo;s modesty prevented him from
recognising his own celebrity. Therefore, we can fancy
his astonishment when, shortly after the death of Prince
Nicholas Esterhazy, a stranger called on him and said, &ldquo;I
am Salomon, from London, and must strike a bargain with
you for that city immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Haydn was dazed with the suddenness of the proposition,
but the old ties were broken up, and his grief needed
recreation and change. Still, he had many beloved friends,
whose society it was hard to leave. Chief among these was
Mozart. &ldquo;Oh, papa,&rdquo; said Mozart, &ldquo;you have had no
training for the wide world, and you speak so few
languages.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, my language is understood all over the
world,&rdquo; said Papa Haydn, with a smile. When he
departed for England, December 15, 1790, Mozart could
with difficulty tear himself away, and said, with pathetic
tears, &ldquo;We shall doubtless now take our last farewell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Haydn and Mozart were perfectly in accord, and each
thought and did well towards the other. Mozart, we know,
was born when Haydn had just reached manhood, so that
when Mozart became old enough to study composition the
earlier works of Haydn&rsquo;s chamber music had been written;
and these undoubtedly formed the studies of the boy
Mozart, and greatly influenced his style; so that Haydn
was the model, and, in a sense, the instructor of Mozart.
Strange is it then to find, in after-years, the master
borrowing (perhaps with interest!) from the pupil. Such,
however, was the fact, as every amateur knows. At this
we can hardly wonder, for Haydn possessed unbounded
admiration not only for Mozart, but also for his music,
which the following shows. Being asked by a friend at
Prague to send him an opera, he replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With all my heart, if you desire to have it for yourself
alone, but if you wish to perform it in public, I must be
excused; for, being written specially for my company at the
Esterhazy Palace, it would not produce the proper effect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
elsewhere. I would do a new score for your theatre, but
what a hazardous step it would be to stand in comparison
with Mozart! Oh, Mozart! If I could instil into the
soul of every lover of music the admiration I have for his
matchless works, all countries would seek to be possessed of
so great a treasure. Let Prague keep him, ah! and well
reward him, for without that the history of geniuses is bad;
alas! we see so many noble minds crushed beneath adversity.
Mozart is incomparable, and I am annoyed that he is
unable to obtain any court appointment. Forgive me if I
get excited when speaking of him, I am so fond of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mozart&rsquo;s admiration for Haydn&rsquo;s music, too, was very
marked. He and Herr Kozeluch were one day listening to
a composition of Haydn&rsquo;s which contained some bold
modulations. Kozeluch thought them strange, and asked
Mozart whether he would have written them. &ldquo;I think
not,&rdquo; smartly replied Mozart, &ldquo;and for this reason:
because they would not have occurred either to you or me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>On another occasion we find Mozart taking to task a
Viennese professor of some celebrity, who used to experience
great delight in turning to Haydn&rsquo;s compositions to
find therein any evidence of the master&rsquo;s want of sound
theoretical training&mdash;a quest in which the pedant occasionally
succeeded. One day he came to Mozart with a
great crime to unfold. Mozart as usual endeavoured to
turn the conversation, but the learned professor still went
chattering on, till at last Mozart shut his mouth with the
following pill&mdash;&ldquo;Sir, if you and I were both melted down
together, we should not furnish materials for one Haydn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was one of the most beautiful friendships in the
history of art, full of tender offices, and utterly free from
the least taint of envy or selfishness.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Haydn landed in England after a voyage which delighted
him in spite of his terror of the sea&mdash;a feeling which seems
to be usual among people of very high musical sensibilities.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
In his diary we find recorded&mdash;&ldquo;By four o&rsquo;clock we had
come twenty miles. The large vessel stood out to sea five
hours longer, till the tide carried it into the harbour. I
remained on deck the whole passage, in order to gaze my
fill at that huge monster&mdash;the ocean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The novelty of Haydn&rsquo;s concerts&mdash;of which he was to
give twenty at fifty pounds apiece&mdash;consisted of their
being his own symphonies, conducted by himself in person.
Haydn&rsquo;s name, during his serene, uneventful years with
the Esterhazys, had become world-famous. His reception
was most brilliant. Dinner parties, receptions, invitations
without end, attested the enthusiasm of the sober English;
and his appearance at concerts and public meetings was the
signal for stormy applause. How, in the press of all this
pleasure in which he was plunged, he continued to compose
the great number of works produced at this time, is a
marvel. He must have been little less than a Briareus.
It was in England that he wrote the celebrated Salomon
symphonies&mdash;the &ldquo;twelve grand,&rdquo; as they are called. They
may well be regarded as the crowning-point of Haydn&rsquo;s
efforts in that form of writing. He took infinite pains with
them, as, indeed, is well proved by an examination of the
scores. More elaborate, more beautiful, and scored for a
fuller orchestra than any others of the one hundred and
twenty or thereabouts which he composed, the Salomon set
also bears marks of the devout and pious spirit in which
Haydn ever laboured.</p>

<p>It is interesting to see how, in many of the great works
which have won the world&rsquo;s admiration, the religion of the
author has gone hand-in-hand with his energy and his
genius; and we find Haydn not ashamed to indorse his
score with his prayer and praise, or to offer the fruits of
his talents to the Giver of all. Thus, the symphony in D
(No. 6) bears on the first page of the score the inscription,
&ldquo;<i>In nomine Domini: di me Giuseppe Haydn, maia
1791, in London</i>;&rdquo; and on the last page, &ldquo;<i>Fine, Laus
Deo, 238</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That genius may sometimes be trusted to judge of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
own work may be gathered from Haydn&rsquo;s own estimate of
these great symphonies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the well-satisfied Salomon, after a successful
performance of one of them, &ldquo;I am strongly of opinion
that you will never surpass these symphonies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; replied Haydn; &ldquo;I never mean to try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The public, as we have said, was enthusiastic; but such
a full banquet of severe orchestral music was a severe trial
to many, and not a few heads would keep time to the music
by steady nods during the slow movements. Haydn, therefore,
composed what is known as the &ldquo;Surprise&rdquo; symphony.
The slow movement is of the most lulling and soothing
character, and about the time the audience should be falling
into its first snooze, the instruments having all died
away into the softest <i>pianissimo</i>, the full orchestra breaks
out with a frightful <small>BANG</small>. It is a question whether the
most vigorous performance of this symphony would startle
an audience nowadays, accustomed to the strident effects of
Wagner and Liszt. A wag in a recent London journal
tells us, indeed, that at the most critical part in the
work a gentleman opened one eye sleepily and said,
&ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Simple-hearted Haydn was delighted at the attention
lavished on him in London. He tells us how he enjoyed
his various entertainments and feastings by such dignitaries
as William Pitt, the Lord Chancellor, and the Duke of
Lids (Leeds). The gentlemen drank freely the whole night,
and the songs, the crazy uproar, and smashing of glasses
were very great. He went down to stay with the Prince
of Wales (George IV.), who played on the violoncello, and
charmed the composer by his kindness. &ldquo;He is the handsomest
man on God&rsquo;s earth. He has an extraordinary love
of music, and a great deal of feeling, but very little
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To stem the tide of Haydn&rsquo;s popularity, the Italian
faction had recourse to Giardini; and they even imported a
pet pupil of Haydn, Pleyel, to conduct the rival concerts.
Our composer kept his temper, and wrote, &ldquo;He [Pleyel]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
behaves himself with great modesty.&rdquo; Later we read,
&ldquo;Pleyel&rsquo;s presumption is a public laughing-stock;&rdquo; but he
adds, &ldquo;I go to all his concerts and applaud him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Far different were the amenities that passed between
Haydn and Giardini. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t know the German hound,&rdquo;
says the latter. Haydn wrote, &ldquo;I attended his concert at
Ranelagh, and he played the fiddle like a hog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the pleasant surprises Haydn had in England
was his visit to Herschel, the great astronomer, in whom
he recognised one of his old oboe-players. The big telescope
amazed him, and so did the patient star-gazer, who
often sat out-of-doors in the most intense cold for five or
six hours at a time.</p>

<p>Our composer returned to Vienna in May 1795, with the
little fortune of 12,000 florins in his pocket.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>In his charming little cottage near Vienna Haydn was
the centre of a brilliant society. Princes and nobles were
proud to do honour to him; and painters, poets, scholars,
and musicians made a delightful coterie, which was not
even disturbed by the political convulsions of the time.
The baleful star of Napoleon shot its disturbing influences
throughout Europe, and the roar of his cannon shook the
established order of things with the echoes of what was to
come. Haydn was passionately attached to his country
and his emperor, and regarded anxiously the rumblings
and quakings of the period; but he did not intermit his
labour, or allow his consecration to his divine art to be in
the least shaken. Like Archimedes of old, he toiled
serenely at his appointed work, while the political order of
things was crumbling before the genius and energy of the
Corsican adventurer.</p>

<p>In 1798 he completed his great oratorio of &ldquo;The
Creation,&rdquo; on which he had spent three years of toil, and
which embodied his brightest genius. Haydn was usually
a very rapid composer, but he seems to have laboured at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
the &ldquo;Creation&rdquo; with a sort of reverential humility, which
never permitted him to think his work worthy or complete.
It soon went the round of Germany, and passed to England
and France, everywhere awakening enthusiasm by its great
symmetry and beauty. Without the sublimity of Handel&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Messiah,&rdquo; it is marked by a richness of melody, a serene
elevation, a matchless variety in treatment, which make it
the most characteristic of Haydn&rsquo;s works. Napoleon, the
first consul, was hastening to the opera-house to hear this,
24th January 1801, when he was stopped by an attempt at
assassination.</p>

<p>Two years after &ldquo;The Creation&rdquo; appeared &ldquo;The
Seasons,&rdquo; founded on Thomson&rsquo;s poem, also a great work,
and one of his last; for the grand old man was beginning
to think of rest, and he only composed two or three
quartets after this. He was now seventy years old, and
went but little from his own home. His chief pleasure was
to sit in his shady garden, and see his friends, who loved to
solace the musical patriarch with cheerful talk and music.
Haydn often fell into deep melancholy, and he tells us that
God revived him; for no more sweet, devout nature ever
lived. His art was ever a religion. A touching incident
of his old age occurred at a grand performance of &ldquo;The
Creation&rdquo; in 1808. Haydn was present, but he was so old
and feeble that he had to be wheeled in a chair into
the theatre, where a princess of the house of Esterhazy took
her seat by his side. This was the last time that Haydn
appeared in public, and a very impressive sight it must
have been to see the aged father of music listening to
&ldquo;The Creation&rdquo; of his younger days, but too old to take
any active share in the performance. The presence of the
old man roused intense enthusiasm among the audience,
which could no longer be suppressed as the chorus and
orchestra burst in full power upon the superb passage,
&ldquo;And there was light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amid the tumult of the enraptured audience the old
composer was seen striving to raise himself. Once on his
feet, he mustered up all his strength, and, in reply to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
applause of the audience, he cried out as loud as he was
able&mdash;&ldquo;No, no! not from me, but,&rdquo; pointing to heaven,
&ldquo;from thence&mdash;from heaven above&mdash;comes all!&rdquo; saying
which, he fell back in his chair, faint and exhausted, and
had to be carried out of the room.</p>

<p>One year after this Vienna was bombarded by the
French, and a shot fell in Haydn&rsquo;s garden. He requested
to be led to his piano, and played the &ldquo;Hymn to the
Emperor&rdquo; three times over with passionate eloquence and
pathos. This was his last performance. He died five days
afterwards, aged seventy-seven, and lies buried in the
cemetery of Gumpfenzdorf, in his own beloved Vienna.</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>The serene, genial face of Haydn, as seen in his portraits,
measures accurately the character of his music. In both we
see healthfulness, good-humour, vivacity, devotional feeling,
and warm affections; a mind contented, but yet attaching
high importance to only one thing in life, the composing of
music. Haydn pursued this with a calm, insatiable
industry, without haste, without rest. His works number
eight hundred, comprising cantatas, symphonies, oratorios,
masses, concertos, trios, sonatas, quartets, minuets, etc.,
and also twenty-two operas, eight German and fourteen
Italian.</p>

<p>As a creative mind in music, Haydn was the father of
the quartet and symphony. Adopting the sonata form as
scientifically illustrated by Emanuel Bach, he introduced
it into compositions for the orchestra and the chamber.
He developed these into a completeness and full-orbed
symmetry, which have never been improved. Mozart is
richer, Beethoven more sublime, Schubert more luxuriant,
Mendelssohn more orchestral and passionate; but Haydn
has never been surpassed in his keen perception of the
capacities of instruments, his subtile distribution of parts,
his variety in treating his themes, and his charmingly
legitimate effects. He fills a large space in musical history,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
not merely from the number, originality, and beauty of
his compositions, but as one who represents an era in
art-development.</p>

<p>In Haydn genius and industry were happily united.
With a marvellously rich flow of musical ideas, he clearly
knew what he meant to do, and never neglected the just
elaboration of each one. He would labour on a theme till
it had shaped itself into perfect beauty.</p>

<p>Haydn is illustrious in the history of art as a complete
artistic life, which worked out all of its contents as did the
great Goethe. In the words of a charming writer: &ldquo;His
life was a rounded whole. There was no broken light about
it; it orbed slowly, with a mild, unclouded lustre, into a
perfect star. Time was gentle with him, and Death was
kind, for both waited upon his genius until all was won.
Mozart was taken away at an age when new and dazzling
effects had not ceased to flash through his brain: at the
very moment when his harmonies began to have a prophetic
ring of the nineteenth century, it was decreed that he
should not see its dawn. Beethoven himself had but just
entered upon an unknown &lsquo;sea whose margin seemed to
fade forever and forever as he moved;&rsquo; but good old Haydn
had come into port over a calm sea and after a prosperous
voyage. The laurel wreath was this time woven about
silver locks; the gathered-in harvest was ripe and golden.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2><a name="mozart" id="mozart"></a><i>MOZART.</i></h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> life of <span class="smcap">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</span>, one of the
immortal names in music, contradicts the rule that extraordinary
youthful talent is apt to be followed by a
sluggish and commonplace maturity. His father entered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
the room one day with a friend, and found the child bending
over a music score. The little Mozart, not yet five
years old, told his father he was writing a concerto for
the piano. The latter examined it, and tears of joy
and astonishment rolled down his face on perceiving its
accuracy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is good, but too difficult for general use,&rdquo; said the
friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Wolfgang, &ldquo;it must be practised till it is
learned. This is the way it goes.&rdquo; So saying, he played it
with perfect correctness.</p>

<p>About the same time he offered to take the violin at
a performance of some chamber music. His father refused,
saying, &ldquo;How can you? You have never learned
the violin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One needs not study for that,&rdquo; said this musical prodigy;
and taking the instrument, he played second violin
with ease and accuracy. Such precocity seems almost
incredible, and only in the history of music does it find
any parallel.</p>

<p>Born in Salzburg, 27th January 1756, he was carefully
trained by his father, who resigned his place as court
musician to devote himself more exclusively to his family.
From the earliest age he showed an extraordinary passion
for music and mathematics, scrawling notes and diagrams
in every place accessible to his insatiate pencil.</p>

<p>Taken to Vienna, the six-year-old virtuoso astonished the
court by his brilliant talents. The future Queen of France,
Marie Antoinette, was particularly delighted with him, and
the little Mozart na&iuml;vely said he would like to marry her,
for she was so good to him. His father devoted several
years to an artistic tour, with him and his little less
talented sister, through the German cities, and it was also
extended to Paris and London. Everywhere the greatest
enthusiasm was evinced in this charming bud of promise.
The father writes home&mdash;&ldquo;We have swords, laces, mantillas,
snuff-boxes, gold cases, sufficient to furnish a shop; but as
for money, it is a scarce article, and I am positively poor.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
At Paris they were warmly received at the court, and the
boy is said to have expressed his surprise when Mdme. Pompadour
refused to kiss him, saying, &ldquo;Who is she, that she
will not kiss me? Have I not been kissed by the queen?&rdquo;
In London his improvisations and piano sonatas excited the
greatest admiration. Here he also published his third
work. These journeys were an uninterrupted chain of
triumphs for the child-virtuoso on the piano, organ, violin,
and in singing. He was made honorary member of the
Academies of Bologna and Verona, decorated with orders,
and received at the age of thirteen an order to write the
opera of &ldquo;Mithridates,&rdquo; which was successfully produced at
Milan in 1770. Several other fine minor compositions were
also written to order at this time for his Italian admirers.
At Rome Mozart attended the Sistine Chapel and wrote
the score of Allegri&rsquo;s great mass, forbidden by the Pope to
be copied, from the memory of a single performance.</p>

<p>The record of Mozart&rsquo;s youthful triumphs might be extended
at great length; but aside from the proof they
furnish of his extraordinary precocity, they have lent little
vital significance in the great problem of his career, except
so far as they stimulated the marvellous boy to lay a deep
foundation for his greater future, which, short as it was,
was fruitful in undying results.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Mozart&rsquo;s life in Paris, where he lived with his mother in
1778 and 1779, was a disappointment, for he despised the
French nation. His deep, simple, German nature revolted
from Parisian frivolity, in which he found only sensuality
and coarseness, disguised under a thin veneering of social
grace. He abhorred French music in these bitter terms&mdash;&ldquo;The
French are and always will be downright donkeys.
They cannot sing, they scream.&rdquo; It was just at this time
that Gluck and Piccini were having their great art-duel.
We get a glimpse of the pious tendency of the young composer
in his characterisation of Voltaire&mdash;&ldquo;The ungodly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
arch-villain, Voltaire, has just died like a dog.&rdquo; Again he
writes&mdash;&ldquo;Friends who have no religion cannot long be my
friends.... I have such a sense of religion that I shall
never do anything that I would not do before the whole
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With Mozart&rsquo;s return to Germany in 1779, being then
twenty-three years of age, comes the dawn of his classical
period as a composer. The greater number of his masses
had already been written, and now he settled himself in
serious earnest to the cultivation of a true German operatic
school. This found its dawn in the production of
&ldquo;Idomeneo,&rdquo; his first really great work for the lyric stage.</p>

<p>The young composer had hard struggles with poverty in
these days. His letters to his father are full of revelations
of his friction with the little worries of life. Lack of money
pinched him close, yet his cheerful spirit was ever buoyant.
&ldquo;I have only one small room; it is quite crammed with a
piano, a table, a bed, and a chest of drawers,&rdquo; he writes.</p>

<p>Yet he would marry; for he was willing to face poverty
in the companionship of a loving woman who dared to face
it with him. At Mannheim he had met a beautiful young
singer, Aloysia Weber, and he went to Munich to offer her
marriage. She, however, saw nothing attractive in the thin,
pale young man, with his long nose, great eyes, and little
head; for he was anything but prepossessing. A younger
sister, Constance, however, secretly loved Mozart, and he
soon transferred his repelled affections to this charming
woman, whom he married in 1782 at the house of Baroness
Waldstetten. His <i>na&iuml;ve</i> reasons for marrying show
Mozart&rsquo;s ingenuous nature. He had no one to take care of
his linen, he would not live dissolutely like other young
men, and he loved Constance Weber. His answer to his
father, who objected on account of his poverty, is worth
quoting:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Constance is a well-conducted, good girl, of respectable
parentage, and I am in a position to earn at least <em>daily bread</em>
for her. We love each other, and are resolved to marry.
All that you have written or may possibly write on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
subject can be nothing but well-meant advice, which,
however good and sensible, can no longer apply to a man
who has gone so far with a girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor as Mozart was, he possessed such integrity and
independence that he refused a most liberal offer from the
King of Prussia to become his chapel-master, for some
unexplained reason which involved his sense of right and
wrong. The first year of his marriage he wrote &ldquo;Il
Seraglio,&rdquo; and made the acquaintance of the aged Gluck,
who took a deep interest in him and warmly praised his
genius. Haydn, too, recognised his brilliant powers. &ldquo;I
tell you, on the word of an honest man,&rdquo; said the author of
the &ldquo;Creation&rdquo; to Leopold Mozart, the father, who asked
his opinion, &ldquo;that I consider your son the greatest composer
I have ever heard. He writes with taste, and possesses a
thorough knowledge of composition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poverty and increasing expense pricked Mozart into
intense, restless energy. His life had no lull in its creative
industry. His splendid genius, insatiable and tireless, broke
down his body, like a sword wearing out its scabbard. He
poured out symphonies, operas, and sonatas with such
prodigality as to astonish us, even when recollecting how
fecund the musical mind has often been. Alike as artist
and composer, he never ceased his labours. Day after day
and night after night he hardly snatched an hour&rsquo;s rest.
We can almost fancy he foreboded how short his brilliant
life was to be, and was impelled to crowd into its brief
compass its largest measure of results.</p>

<p>Yet he was always pursued by the spectre of want.
Oftentimes his sick wife could not obtain needed medicines.
He made more money than most musicians, yet was
always impoverished. But it was his glory that he was
never impoverished by sensual indulgence, extravagance,
and riotous living, but by his lavish generosity to those
who in many instances needed help less than himself.
Like many other men of genius and sensibility, he could
not say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to even the pretence of distress and suffering.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span></p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The culminating point of Mozart&rsquo;s artistic development
was in 1786. The &ldquo;Marriage of Figaro&rdquo; was the first of
a series of masterpieces which cannot be surpassed alike
for musical greatness and their hold on the lyric stage.
The next year &ldquo;Don Giovanni&rdquo; saw the light, and was
produced at Prague. The overture of this opera was
composed and scored in less than six hours. The inhabitants
of Prague greeted the work with the wildest
enthusiasm, for they seemed to understand Mozart better
than the Viennese.</p>

<p>During this period he made frequent concert tours to
recruit his fortunes, but with little financial success.
Presents of watches, snuff-boxes, and rings were common,
but the returns were so small that Mozart was frequently
obliged to pawn his gifts to purchase a dinner and
lodging. What a comment on the period which adored
genius, but allowed it to starve! His audiences could be
enthusiastic enough to carry him to his hotel on their
shoulders, but probably never thought that the wherewithal
of a hearty supper was a more seasonable homage. So
our musician struggled on through the closing years of his
life with the wolf constantly at his door, and an invalid
wife whom he passionately loved, yet must needs see
suffer from the want of common necessaries. In these
modern days, when distinguished artists make princely
fortunes by the exercise of their musical gifts, it is not
easy to believe that Mozart, recognised as the greatest
pianoforte player and composer of his time by all of musical
Germany, could suffer such dire extremes of want as to be
obliged more than once to beg for a dinner.</p>

<p>In 1791 he composed the score of the &ldquo;Magic Flute&rdquo; at
the request of Schikaneder, a Viennese manager, who had
written the text from a fairy tale, the fantastic elements
of which are peculiarly German in their humour. Mozart
put great earnestness into the work, and made it the first
German opera of commanding merit, which embodied the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
essential intellectual sentiment and kindly warmth of popular
German life. The manager paid the composer but a trifle
for a work whose transcendent success enabled him to build
a new opera-house, and laid the foundation of a large fortune.
We are told, too, that at the time of Mozart&rsquo;s death
in extreme want, when his sick wife, half-maddened with
grief, could not buy a coffin for the dead composer, this
hard-hearted wretch, who owed his all to the genius of the
great departed, rushed about through Vienna bewailing the
loss to music with sentimental tears, but did not give the
heart-broken widow one kreutzer to pay the expense of a
decent burial.</p>

<p>In 1791 Mozart&rsquo;s health was breaking down with great
rapidity, though he himself would never recognise his own
swiftly advancing fate. He experienced, however, a deep
melancholy which nothing could remove. For the first
time his habitual cheerfulness deserted him. His wife had
been enabled through the kindness of her friends to visit
the healing waters of Baden, and was absent.</p>

<p>An incident now occurred which impressed Mozart with
an ominous chill. One night there came a stranger, singularly
dressed in grey, with an order for a requiem to be
composed without fail within a month. The visitor, without
revealing his name, departed in mysterious gloom, as
he came. Again the stranger called, and solemnly reminded
Mozart of his promise. The composer easily persuaded
himself that this was a visitor from the other world, and
that the requiem would be his own; for he was exhausted
with labour and sickness, and easily became the prey of
superstitious fancies. When his wife returned, she found
him with a fatal pallor on his face, silent and melancholy,
labouring with intense absorption on the funereal mass.
He would sit brooding over the score till he swooned away
in his chair, and only come to consciousness to bend his
waning energies again to their ghastly work. The mysterious
visitor, whom Mozart believed to be the precursor of
his death, we now know to have been Count Walseck, who had
recently lost his wife, and wished a musical memorial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
His final sickness attacked the composer while labouring
at the requiem. The musical world was ringing with the
fame of his last opera. To the dying man was brought the
offer of the rich appointment of organist of St. Stephen&rsquo;s
Cathedral. Most flattering propositions were made him
by eager managers, who had become thoroughly awake to
his genius when it was too late. The great Mozart was
dying in the very prime of his youth and his powers, when
success was in his grasp and the world opening wide its
arms to welcome his glorious gifts with substantial recognition;
but all too late, for he was doomed to die in his
spring-tide, though &ldquo;a spring mellow with all the fruits of
autumn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The unfinished requiem lay on the bed, and his last
efforts were to imitate some peculiar instrumental effects,
as he breathed out his life in the arms of his wife and his
friend, S&uuml;ssmaier.</p>

<p>The epilogue to this life-drama is one of the saddest in
the history of art: a pauper funeral for one of the world&rsquo;s
greatest geniuses. &ldquo;It was late one winter afternoon,&rdquo;
says an old record, &ldquo;before the coffin was deposited on the
side aisles on the south side of St. Stephen&rsquo;s. Van Swieten,
Salieri, S&uuml;ssmaier, and two unknown musicians were the
only persons present besides the officiating priest and the
pall-bearers. It was a terribly inclement day; rain and
sleet came down fast; and an eye-witness describes how
the little band of mourners stood shivering in the blast,
with their umbrellas up, round the hearse, as it left the
door of the church. It was then far on in the dark, cold
December afternoon, and the evening was fast closing in
before the solitary hearse had passed the Stubenthor, and
reached the distant graveyard of St. Marx, in which, among
the &lsquo;third class,&rsquo; the great composer of the &lsquo;G&nbsp;minor Symphony&rsquo;
and the &lsquo;Requiem&rsquo; found his resting-place. By
this time the weather had proved too much for all the
mourners; they had dropped off one by one, and Mozart&rsquo;s
body was accompanied only by the driver of the carriage.
There had been already two pauper funerals that day&mdash;one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
of them a midwife&mdash;and Mozart was to be the third in the
grave and the uppermost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the hearse drew up in the slush and sleet at the
gate of the graveyard, it was welcomed by a strange pair&mdash;Franz
Harruschka, the assistant grave-digger, and his
mother, Katharina, known as &lsquo;Frau Katha,&rsquo; who filled the
quaint office of official mendicant to the place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old woman was the first to speak: &lsquo;Any coaches
or mourners coming?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A shrug from the driver of the hearse was the only
response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whom have you got there, then?&rsquo; continued she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A bandmaster,&rsquo; replied the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A musician? they&rsquo;re a poor lot; then I&rsquo;ve no more
money to look for to-day. It is to be hoped we shall have
better luck in the morning.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To which the driver said, with a laugh, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m devilish
thirsty, too&mdash;not a kreutzer of drink-money have I had.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After this curious colloquy the coffin was dismounted
and shoved into the top of the grave already occupied by
the two paupers of the morning; and such was Mozart&rsquo;s
last appearance on earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To-day no stone marks the spot where were deposited
the last remains of one of the brightest of musical spirits;
indeed, the very grave is unknown, for it was the grave of
a pauper.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Mozart&rsquo;s charming letters reveal to us such a gentle,
sparkling, affectionate nature, as to inspire as much love
for the man as admiration for his genius. Sunny humour
and tenderness bubble in almost every sentence. A clever
writer says that &ldquo;opening these is like opening a painted
tomb.... The colours are all fresh, the figures are all
distinct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No better illustration of the man Mozart can be had
than in a few extracts from his correspondence. He
writes to his sister from Rome while yet a mere lad:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
&ldquo;I am, thank God! except my miserable pen, well, and
send you and mamma a thousand kisses. I wish you were
in Rome; I am sure it would please you. Papa says I am
a little fool, but that is nothing new. Here we have but
one bed; it is easy to understand that I can&rsquo;t rest comfortably
with papa. I shall be glad when we get into new
quarters. I have just finished drawing the Holy Peter
with his keys, the Holy Paul with his sword, and the Holy
Luke with my sister. I have had the honour of kissing
St. Peter&rsquo;s foot; and because I am so small as to be
unable to reach it, they had to lift me up. I am the same
old</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Wolfgang</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Mozart was very fond of this sister Nannerl, and he
used to write to her in a playful mosaic of French, German,
and Italian. Just after his wedding he writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;My darling is now a hundred times more joyful at the
idea of going to Salzburg, and I am willing to stake&mdash;ay,
my very life, that you will rejoice still more in my
happiness when you know her; if, indeed, in your estimation,
as in mine, a high-principled, honest, virtuous, and
pleasing wife ought to make a man happy.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Late in his short life he writes the following characteristic
note to a friend, whose life does not appear to have
been one of the most regular:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me, my dear friend, how you are. I hope
you are all as well as we are. You cannot fail to be happy,
for you possess everything that you can wish for at your
age and in your position, especially as you now seem to
have entirely given up your former mode of life. Do you
not every day become more convinced of the truth of the
little lectures I used to inflict on you? Are not the
pleasures of a transient, capricious passion widely different
from the happiness produced by rational and true love? I
feel sure that you often in your heart thank me for my
admonitions. I shall feel quite proud if you do. But,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
jesting apart, you do really owe me some little gratitude
if you are become worthy of Fr&auml;ulein N&mdash;&mdash;, for I certainly
played no insignificant part in your improvement or
reform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My great-grandfather used to say to his wife, my great-grandmother,
who in turn told it to her daughter, my
grandmother, who again repeated it to her daughter, my
mother, who repeated it to her daughter, my own sister,
that it was a very great art to talk eloquently and well, but
an equally great one to know the right moment to stop. I
therefore shall follow the advice of my sister, thanks to our
mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, and thus end,
not only my moral ebullition, but my letter.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>His playful tenderness lavished itself on his wife in a
thousand quaint ways. He would, for example, rise long
before her to take his horseback exercise, and always kiss
her sleeping face and leave a little note like the following
resting on her forehead&mdash;&ldquo;Good-morning, dear little wife!
I hope you have had a good sleep and pleasant dreams. I
shall be back in two hours. Behave yourself like a good
little girl, and don&rsquo;t run away from your husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Speaking of an infant child, our composer would say
merrily, &ldquo;That boy will be a true Mozart, for he always
cries in the very key in which I am playing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mozart&rsquo;s musical greatness, shown in the symmetry of
his art as well as in the richness of his inspirations, has
been unanimously acknowledged by his brother composers.
Meyerbeer could not restrain his tears when speaking of
him. Weber, Mendelssohn, Rossini, and Wagner always
praise him in terms of enthusiastic admiration. Haydn
called him the greatest of composers. In fertility of invention,
beauty of form, and exactness of method, he has
never been surpassed, and has but one or two rivals. The
composer of three of the greatest operas in musical history,
besides many of much more than ordinary excellence; of
symphonies that rival Haydn&rsquo;s for symmetry and melodic
affluence; of a great number of quartets, quintets, etc.;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
and of pianoforte sonatas which rank high among the best;
of many masses that are standard in the service of the
Catholic Church; of a great variety of beautiful songs&mdash;there
is hardly any form of music which he did not richly
adorn with the treasures of his genius. We may well say,
in the words of one of the most competent critics:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mozart was a king and a slave&mdash;king in his own
beautiful realm of music; slave of the circumstances and the
conditions of this world. Once over the boundaries of his
own kingdom, and he was supreme; but the powers of the
earth acknowledged not his sovereignty.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="beethoven" id="beethoven"></a><i>BEETHOVEN.</i></h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> name and memory of this composer awaken, in the
heart of the lover of music, sentiments of the deepest
reverence and admiration. His life was so marked with
affliction and so isolated as to make him, in his environment
of conditions as a composer, an unique figure.</p>

<p>The principal fact which made the exterior life of Beethoven
so bare of the ordinary pleasures that brighten and
sweeten existence, his total deafness, greatly enriched his
spiritual life. Music finally became to him a purely intellectual
conception, for he was without any sensual enjoyment
of its effects. To this Samson of music, for whom
the ear was like the eye to other men, Milton&rsquo;s lines may
indeed well apply:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Oh! dark, dark, dark, amid the blaze of noon!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Irrecoverably dark&mdash;total eclipse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without all hope of day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh first created Beam, and thou, great Word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Let there be light,&rsquo; and light was over all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why am I thus bereaved thy prime decree?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun to me is dark.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
To his severe affliction we owe alike many of the defects
of his character and the splendours of his genius. All his
powers, concentrated into a spiritual focus, wrought such
things as lift him into a solitary greatness. The world has
agreed to measure this man as it measures Homer, Dante,
and Shakespeare. We do not compare him with others.</p>

<p>Beethoven had the reputation among his contemporaries
of being harsh, bitter, suspicious, and unamiable. There is
much to justify this in the circumstances of his life; yet
our readers will discover much to show, on the other hand,
how deep, strong, and tender was the heart which was so
wrung and tortured, and wounded to the quick by&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Weber gives a picture of Beethoven&mdash;&ldquo;The square
Cyclopean figure attired in a shabby coat with torn
sleeves.&rdquo; Everybody will remember his noble, austere
face, as seen in the numerous prints: the square, massive
head, with the forest of rough hair; the strong features, so
furrowed with the marks of passion and sadness; the eyes,
with their look of introspection and insight; the whole
expression of the countenance as of an ancient prophet.
Such was the impression made by Beethoven on all who
saw him, except in his moods of fierce wrath, which towards
the last were not uncommon, though short-lived. A sorely
tried, sublimely gifted man, he met his fate stubbornly, and
worked out his great mission with all his might and main,
through long years of weariness and trouble. Posterity has
rewarded him by enthroning him on the highest peaks of
musical fame.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Ludwig van Beethoven</span> was born at Bonn in 1770. It
is a singular fact that at an early age he showed the deepest
distaste for music, unlike the other great composers, who
evinced their bent from their earliest years. His father
was obliged to whip him severely before he would consent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
to sit down at the harpsichord; and it was not till he was
past ten that his genuine interest in music showed itself.
His first compositions displayed his genius. Mozart heard
him play them, and said, &ldquo;Mind, you will hear that boy
talked of.&rdquo; Haydn, too, met Beethoven for the first and
only time when the former was on his way to England,
and recognised his remarkable powers. He gave him a few
lessons in composition, and was after that anxious to claim
the young Titan as a pupil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; growled Beethoven, who for some queer reason
never liked Haydn, &ldquo;I had some lessons of him, indeed,
but I was not his disciple. I never learned anything from
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beethoven made a profound impression even as a youth
on all who knew him. Aside from the palpable marks of
his power, there was an indomitable <i>hauteur</i>, a mysterious,
self-wrapped air as of one constantly communing with the
invisible, an unconscious assertion of mastery about him,
which strongly impressed the imagination.</p>

<p>At the very outset of his career, when life promised all
fair and bright things to him, two comrades linked themselves
to him, and ever after that refused to give him up&mdash;grim
poverty and still grimmer disease. About the same
time that he lost a fixed salary through the death of his
friend, the Elector of Cologne, he began to grow deaf.
Early in 1800, walking one day in the woods with his
devoted friend and pupil, Ferdinand Ries, he disclosed the
sad secret to him that the whole joyous world of sound was
being gradually closed up to him; the charm of the human
voice, the notes of the woodland birds, the sweet babblings
of Nature, jargon to others, but intelligible to genius, the
full-born splendours of <em>heard</em> music&mdash;all, all were fast
receding from his grasp.</p>

<p>Beethoven was extraordinarily sensitive to the influences
of Nature. Before his disease became serious he writes&mdash;&ldquo;I
wander about here with music-paper among the hills,
and dales, and valleys, and scribble a good deal. No man
on earth can love the country as I do.&rdquo; But one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
Nature&rsquo;s most delightful modes of speech to man was soon
to be utterly lost to him. At last he became so deaf that
the most stunning crash of thunder or the <i>fortissimo</i> of the
full orchestra were to him as if they were not. His bitter,
heart-rending cry of agony, when he became convinced
that the misfortune was irremediable, is full of eloquent
despair&mdash;&ldquo;As autumn leaves wither and fall, so are my
hopes blighted. Almost as I came, I depart. Even the
lofty courage, which so often animated me in the lovely
days of summer, is gone forever. O Providence! vouchsafe
me one day of pure felicity! How long have I been
estranged from the glad echo of true joy! When, O my
God! when shall I feel it again in the temple of Nature
and man? Never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the small-souled, mole-eyed gossips and critics called
him hard, churlish, and cynical&mdash;him, for whom the richest
thing in Nature&rsquo;s splendid dower had been obliterated,
except a soul, which never in its deepest sufferings lost its
noble faith in God and man, or allowed its indomitable
courage to be one whit weakened. That there were periods
of utterly rayless despair and gloom we may guess; but not
for long did Beethoven&rsquo;s great nature cower before its evil
genius.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Within three years, from 1805 to 1808, Beethoven
composed some of his greatest works&mdash;the oratorio of &ldquo;The
Mount of Olives,&rdquo; the opera of &ldquo;Fidelio,&rdquo; and the two
noble symphonies, &ldquo;Pastorale&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eroica,&rdquo; besides
a large number of concertos, sonatas, songs, and other
occasional pieces. However gloomy the externals of his
life, his creative activities knew no cessation.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Sinfonia Eroica,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Choral&rdquo; only excepted,
is the longest of the immortal nine, and is one of the
greatest examples of musical portraiture extant. All the
great composers from Handel to Wagner have attempted,
what is called descriptive music with more or less success,
but never have musical genius and skill achieved a result so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
admirable in its relation to its purpose and by such strictly
legitimate means as in this work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Eroica,&rsquo;&rdquo; says a great writer, &ldquo;is an attempt to
draw a musical portrait of an historical character&mdash;a great
statesman, a great general, a noble individual; to represent
in music&mdash;Beethoven&rsquo;s own language&mdash;what M. Thiers has
given in words, and Paul Delaroche in painting.&rdquo; Of
Beethoven&rsquo;s success another writer has said&mdash;&ldquo;It wants no
title to tell its meaning, for throughout the symphony the
hero is visibly portrayed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is anything but difficult to realise why Beethoven
should have admired the first Napoleon. Both the soldier
and musician were made of that sturdy stuff which would
and did defy the world; and it is not strange that
Beethoven should have desired in some way&mdash;and he knew
of no better course than through his art&mdash;to honour one so
characteristically akin to himself, and who at that time was
the most prominent man in Europe. Beethoven began the
work in 1802, and in 1804 it was completed, and bore the
following title:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">Sinfonia grande<br />
&ldquo;Napoleon Bonaparte&rdquo;<br />
1804 in August<br />
del Sigr<br />
Louis van Beethoven<br />
Sinfonia 3.<br />
Op. 55.</p>

<p>This was copied and the original score despatched to the
ambassador for presentation, while Beethoven retained the
copy. Before the composition was laid before Napoleon,
however, the great general had accepted the title of
Emperor. No sooner did Beethoven hear of this from his
pupil Ries than he started up in a rage, and exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;After
all, then, he&rsquo;s nothing but an ordinary mortal! He
will trample the rights of men under his feet!&rdquo; saying
which, he rushed to his table, seized the copy of the score,
and tore the title-page completely off. From this time
Beethoven hated Napoleon, and never again spoke of him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
in connection with the symphony until he heard of his
death in St. Helena, when he observed, &ldquo;I have already
composed music for this calamity,&rdquo; evidently referring
to the &ldquo;Funeral March&rdquo; in this symphony.</p>

<p>The opera of &ldquo;Fidelio,&rdquo; which he composed about the
same time, may be considered, in the severe sense of a great
and symmetrical musical work, the finest lyric drama ever
written, with the possible exception of Gluck&rsquo;s &ldquo;Orpheus
and Eurydice&rdquo; and &ldquo;Iphigenia in Tauris.&rdquo; It is rarely
performed, because its broad, massive, and noble effects are
beyond the capacity of most singers, and belong to the
domain of pure music, demanding but little alliance with
the artistic clap-trap of startling scenery and histrionic
extravagance. Yet our composer&rsquo;s conscience shows its
completeness in his obedience to the law of opera; for the
music he has written to express the situations cannot be
surpassed for beauty, pathos, and passion. Beethoven, like
Mendelssohn, revolted from the idea of lyric drama as an
art-inconsistency, but he wrote &ldquo;Fidelio&rdquo; to show his
possibilities in a direction with which he had but little sympathy.
He composed four overtures for this opera at
different periods, on account of the critical caprices of the
Viennese public&mdash;a concession to public taste which his
stern independence rarely made.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Beethoven&rsquo;s relations with women were peculiar and
characteristic, as were all the phases of a nature singularly
self-poised and robust. Like all men of powerful imagination
and keen (though perhaps not delicate) sensibility, he
was strongly attracted towards the softer sex. But a certain
austerity of morals, and that purity of feeling which is the
inseparable shadow of one&rsquo;s devotion to lofty aims, always
kept him within the bounds of Platonic affection. Yet
there is enough in Beethoven&rsquo;s letters, as scanty as their
indications are in this direction, to show what ardour and
glow of feeling he possessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
About the time that he was suffering keenly with the
knowledge of his fast-growing infirmity, he was bound by a
strong tie of affection to Countess Giulietta Guicciardi, his
&ldquo;immortal beloved,&rdquo; &ldquo;his angel,&rdquo; &ldquo;his all,&rdquo; &ldquo;his life,&rdquo; as
he called her in a variety of passionate utterances. It was
to her that he dedicated his song &ldquo;Adelaida,&rdquo; which, as an
expression of lofty passion, is world-famous. Beethoven
was very much dissatisfied with the work even in the glow
of composition. Before the notes were dry on the music
paper, the composer&rsquo;s old friend Barth was announced.
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Beethoven, putting a roll of score paper in
Barth&rsquo;s hands, &ldquo;look at that. I have just finished it, and
don&rsquo;t like it. There is hardly fire enough in the stove to
burn it, but I will try.&rdquo; Barth glanced through the composition,
then sang it, and soon grew into such enthusiasm
as to draw from Beethoven the expression, &ldquo;No? then we
will not burn it, old fellow.&rdquo; Whether it was the reaction
of disgust, which so often comes to genius after the tension
of work, or whether his ideal of its lovely theme was so
high as to make all effort seem inadequate, the world came
very near losing what it could not afford to have missed.</p>

<p>The charming countess, however, preferred rank, wealth,
and unruffled ease to being linked even with a great genius,
if, indeed, the affair ever looked in the direction of marriage.
She married another, and Beethoven does not seem to have
been seriously disturbed. It may be that, like Goethe, he
valued the love of woman not for itself or its direct results,
but as an art-stimulus which should enrich and fructify his
own intellectual life.</p>

<p>We get glimpses of successors to the fair countess. The
beautiful Marie Pachler was for some time the object of
his adoration. The affair is a somewhat mysterious one,
and the lady seems to have suffered from the fire through
which her powerful companion passed unscathed. Again,
quaintest and oddest of all, is the fancy kindled by that
&ldquo;mysterious sprite of genius,&rdquo; as one of her contemporaries
calls her, Bettina Brentano, the gifted child-woman, who
fascinated all who came within her reach, from Goethe and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
Beethoven down to princes and nobles. Goethe&rsquo;s correspondence
with this strange being has embalmed her life
in classic literature.</p>

<p>Our composer&rsquo;s intercourse with women&mdash;for he was
always alive to the charms of female society&mdash;was for the
most part homely and practical in the extreme, after his
deafness destroyed the zest of the more romantic phases of
the divine passion. He accepted adoration, as did Dean
Swift, as a right. He permitted his female admirers to
knit him stockings and comforters, and make him dainty
puddings and other delicacies, which he devoured with huge
gusto. He condescended, in return, to go to sleep on their
sofas, after picking his teeth with the candle-snuffers (so
says scandal), while they thrummed away at his sonatas,
the artistic slaughter of which Beethoven was mercifully
unable to hear.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>The friendship of the Archduke Rudolph relieved
Beethoven of the immediate pressure of poverty; for in
1809 he settled a small life-pension upon him. The next
ten years were passed by him in comparative ease and comfort,
and in this time he gave to the world five of his
immortal symphonies, and a large number of his finest
sonatas and masses. His general health improved very
much; and in his love for his nephew Karl, whom
Beethoven had adopted, the lonely man found an outlet
for his strong affections, which was medicine for his soul,
though the object was worthless and ungrateful.</p>

<p>We get curious and amusing insights into the daily tenor
of Beethoven&rsquo;s life during this period&mdash;things sometimes
almost grotesque, were they not so sad. The composer
lived a solitary life, and was very much at the mercy of his
servants on account of his self-absorption and deafness.
He was much worried by these prosaic cares. One story of
a slatternly servant is as follows:&mdash;The master was working
at the mass in D, the great work which he commenced in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
1819 for the celebration of the appointment of the Archduke
Rudolph as Archbishop of Olm&uuml;tz, and which should
have been completed by the following year. Beethoven,
however, became so engrossed with his work, and increased
its proportions so much, that it was not finished until some
two years after the event which it was intended to celebrate.
While Beethoven was engaged upon this score, he one day
woke up to the fact that some of his pages were missing.
&ldquo;Where on earth could they be?&rdquo; he asked himself, and
the servant too; but the problem remained unsolved.
Beethoven, beside himself, spent hours and hours in searching,
and so did the servant, but it was all in vain. At last
they gave up the task as a useless one, and Beethoven, mad
with despair, and pouring the very opposite to blessings
upon the head of her who, he believed, was the author of
the mischief, sat down with the conclusion that he must rewrite
the missing part. He had no sooner commenced a
new Kyrie&mdash;for this was the movement which was not to
be found&mdash;than some loose sheets of score paper were
discovered in the kitchen! Upon examination they proved
to be the identical pages that Beethoven so much desired,
and which the woman, in her anxiety to be &ldquo;tidy&rdquo; and to
&ldquo;keep things straight,&rdquo; had appropriated at some time or
other for wrapping up, not only old boots and clothes, but also
some superannuated pots and pans that were greasy and black!</p>

<p>Thus he was continually fretted by the carelessness or
the rascality of the servants in whom he was obliged to
trust. He writes in his diary&mdash;&ldquo;Nancy is too uneducated
for a housekeeper&mdash;indeed, quite a beast.&rdquo; &ldquo;My precious
servants were occupied from seven o&rsquo;clock till ten trying to
kindle a fire.&rdquo; &ldquo;The cook&rsquo;s off again.&rdquo; &ldquo;I shied half-a-dozen
books at her head.&rdquo; They made his dinner so nasty
he couldn&rsquo;t eat it. &ldquo;No soup to-day, no beef, no eggs.
Got something from the inn at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His temper and peculiarities, too, made it difficult for
him to live in peace with landlords and fellow-lodgers. As
his deafness increased, he struck and thumped harder at
the keys of his piano, the sound of which he could scarcely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
hear. Nor was this all. The music that filled his brain
gave him no rest. He became an inspired madman. For
hours he would pace the room &ldquo;howling and roaring&rdquo;
(as his pupil Ries puts it); or he would stand beating
time with hand and foot to the music which was so vividly
present to his mind. This soon put him into a feverish
excitement, when, to cool himself, he would take his water-jug,
and, thoughtless of everything, pour its contents over
his hands, after which he could sit down to his piano.
With all this it can easily be imagined that Beethoven was
frequently remonstrated with. The landlord complained of
a damaged ceiling, and the fellow-lodgers declared that
either they or the madman must leave the house, for they
could get no rest where he was. So Beethoven never for
long had a resting-place. Impatient at being interfered
with, he immediately packed up and went off to some other
vacant lodging. From this cause he was at one time
paying the rent of four lodgings at once. At times he
would get tired of this changing from one place to another&mdash;from
the suburbs to the town&mdash;and then he would fall
back upon the hospitable home of a patron, once again
taking possession of an apartment which he had vacated,
probably without the least explanation or cause. One
admirer of his genius, who always reserved him a chamber
in his establishment, used to say to his servants&mdash;&ldquo;Leave
it empty; Beethoven is sure to come back again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The instant that Beethoven entered the house he began
to write and cipher on the walls, the blinds, the table,
everything, in the most abstracted manner. He frequently
composed on slips of paper, which he afterwards misplaced,
so that he had great difficulty in finding them. At one
time, indeed, he forgot his own name and the date of his
birth.</p>

<p>It is said that he once went into a Viennese restaurant,
and, instead of giving an order, began to write a score on
the back of the bill-of-fare, absorbed and unconscious of
time and place. At last he asked how much he owed.
&ldquo;You owe nothing, sir,&rdquo; said the waiter. &ldquo;What! do you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
think I have not dined?&rdquo; &ldquo;Most assuredly.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very
well, then, give me something.&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you wish?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These infirmities do not belittle the man of genius, but
set off his greatness as with a foil. They illustrate the
thought of Goethe: &ldquo;It is all the same whether one is great
or small, he has to pay the reckoning of humanity.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Yet beneath these eccentricities what wealth of tenderness,
sympathy, and kindliness existed! His affection for
his graceless nephew Karl is a touching picture. With the
rest of his family he had never been on very cordial terms.
His feeling of contempt for snobbery and pretence is very
happily illustrated in his relations with his brother Johann.
The latter had acquired property, and he sent Ludwig his
card, inscribed &ldquo;Johann von Beethoven, land-owner.&rdquo; The
caustic reply was a card, on which was written, &ldquo;Ludwig
von Beethoven, brain-owner.&rdquo; But on Karl all the warmest
feelings of a nature which had been starving to love and be
loved poured themselves out. He gave the scapegrace
every luxury and indulgence, and, self-absorbed as he was
in an ideal sphere, felt the deepest interest in all the most
trivial things that concerned him. Much to the uncle&rsquo;s
sorrow, Karl cared nothing for music; but, worst of all, he
was an idle, selfish, heartless fellow, who sneered at his
benefactor, and valued him only for what he could get from
him. At last Beethoven became fully aware of the lying
ingratitude of his nephew, and he exclaims&mdash;&ldquo;I know now
you have no pleasure in coming to see me, which is only
natural, for my atmosphere is too pure for you. God has
never yet forsaken me, and no doubt some one will be found
to close my eyes.&rdquo; Yet the generous old man forgave him,
for he says in the codicil of his will, &ldquo;I appoint my nephew
Karl my sole heir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frequently, glimpses of the true vein showed themselves
in such little episodes as that which occurred when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
Moscheles, accompanied by his brother, visited the great
musician for the first time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrived at the door of the house,&rdquo; writes Moscheles, &ldquo;I
had some misgivings, knowing Beethoven&rsquo;s strong aversion
to strangers. I therefore told my brother to wait below.
After greeting Beethoven, I said, &lsquo;Will you permit me to
introduce my brother to you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where is he?&rsquo; he suddenly replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Below.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What, downstairs?&rsquo; and Beethoven immediately
rushed off, seized hold of my brother, saying, &lsquo;Am I such
a savage that you are afraid to come near me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After this he showed great kindness to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While referring to the relations of Moscheles and
Beethoven, the following anecdote related by Mdme.
Moscheles will be found suggestive. The pianist had
been arranging some numbers of &ldquo;Fidelio,&rdquo; which he took
to the composer. He, <i>&agrave; la</i> Haydn, had inscribed the score
with the words, &ldquo;By God&rsquo;s help.&rdquo; Beethoven did not fail
to perceive this, and he wrote underneath this phylactory
the characteristic advice&mdash;&ldquo;O man, help thyself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The genial and sympathetic nature of Beethoven is
illustrated in this quaint incident:&mdash;</p>

<p>It was in the summer of 1811 that Ludwig L&ouml;we, the
actor, first met Beethoven in the dining-room of the Blue
Star at T&ouml;plitz. L&ouml;we was paying his addresses to the
landlord&rsquo;s daughter; and conversation being impossible at
the hour he dined there, the charming creature one day
whispered to him, &ldquo;Come at a later hour, when the
customers are gone and only Beethoven is here. He cannot
hear, and will therefore not be in the way.&rdquo; This answered
for a time; but the stern parents, observing the acquaintanceship,
ordered the actor to leave the house and not to
return. &ldquo;How great was our despair!&rdquo; relates L&ouml;we.
&ldquo;We both desired to correspond, but through whom?
Would the solitary man at the opposite table assist us?
Despite his serious reserve and seeming churlishness, I
believe he is not unfriendly. I have often caught a kind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
smile across his bold, defiant face.&rdquo; L&ouml;we determined to try.
Knowing Beethoven&rsquo;s custom, he contrived to meet the
master when he was walking in the gardens. Beethoven
instantly recognised him, and asked the reason why he
no longer dined at the Blue Star. A full confession was
made, and then L&ouml;we timidly asked if he would take charge
of a letter to give to the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; pleasantly observed the rough-looking
musician. &ldquo;You mean what is right.&rdquo; So pocketing the
note, he was making his way onward when L&ouml;we again
interfered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Herr von Beethoven, that is not all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, so,&rdquo; said the master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must also bring back the answer,&rdquo; L&ouml;we went on
to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meet me here at this time to-morrow,&rdquo; said Beethoven.</p>

<p>L&ouml;we did so, and there found Beethoven awaiting him,
with the coveted reply from his lady-love. In this manner
Beethoven carried the letters backward and forward for
some five or six weeks&mdash;in short, as long as he remained in
the town.</p>

<p>His friendship with Ferdinand Ries commenced in a way
which testified how grateful he was for kindness. When
his mother lay ill at Bonn, he hurried home from Vienna
just in time to witness her death. After the funeral he
suffered greatly from poverty, and was relieved by Ries, the
violinist. Years afterwards young Ries waited on Beethoven
with a letter of introduction from his father. The composer
received him with cordial warmth, and said, &ldquo;Tell
your father I have not forgotten the death of my mother.&rdquo;
Ever afterwards he was a helpful and devoted friend to
young Ries, and was of inestimable value in forwarding his
musical career.</p>

<p>Beethoven in his poverty never forgot to be generous.
At a concert given in aid of wounded soldiers, where he
conducted, he indignantly refused payment with the words,
&ldquo;Say Beethoven never accepts anything where humanity
is concerned.&rdquo; To an Ursuline convent he gave an entirely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
new symphony to be performed at their benefit concert.
Friend or enemy never applied to him for help that he did
not freely give, even to the pinching of his own comfort.</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>Rossini could write best when he was under the influence
of Italian wine and sparkling champagne. Paisiello liked
the warm bed in which to jot down his musical notions, and
we are told that &ldquo;it was between the sheets that he planned
the &lsquo;Barber of Seville,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Molinara,&rsquo; and so many other <i>chefs-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i>
of ease and gracefulness.&rdquo; Mozart could chat and
play at billiards or bowls at the same time that he composed
the most beautiful music. Sacchini found it impossible to
write anything of any beauty unless a pretty woman was by
his side, and he was surrounded by his cats, whose graceful
antics stimulated and affected him in a marked fashion.
&ldquo;Gluck,&rdquo; Bombet says, &ldquo;in order to warm his imagination
and to transport himself to Aulis or Sparta, was accustomed
to place himself in the middle of a beautiful meadow. In
this situation, with his piano before him, and a bottle of
champagne on each side, he wrote in the open air his two
&lsquo;Iphigenias,&rsquo; his &lsquo;Orpheus,&rsquo; and some other works.&rdquo; The
agencies which stimulated Beethoven&rsquo;s grandest thoughts
are eminently characteristic of the man. He loved to let
the winds and storms beat on his bare head, and see the dazzling
play of the lightning. Or, failing the sublimer moods
of Nature, it was his delight to walk in the woods and
fields, and take in at every pore the influences which she
so lavishly bestows on her favourites. His true life was
his ideal life in art. To him it was a mission and an
inspiration, the end and object of all things; for these had
value only as they fed the divine craving within.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing can be more sublime,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;than to
draw nearer to the Godhead than other men, and to diffuse
here on earth these Godlike rays among mortals.&rdquo; Again:
&ldquo;What is all this compared to the grandest of all Masters
of Harmony&mdash;above, above?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last four years of our composer&rsquo;s life were passed amid
great distress from poverty and feebleness. He could compose
but little; and, though his friends solaced his latter
days with attention and kindness, his sturdy independence
would not accept more. It is a touching fact that Beethoven
voluntarily suffered want and privation in his last
years, that he might leave the more to his selfish and ungrateful
nephew. He died in 1827, in his fifty-seventh
year, and is buried in the Wahring Cemetery near Vienna.
Let these extracts from a testamentary paper addressed to
his brothers in 1802, in expectation of death, speak more
eloquently of the hidden life of a heroic soul than any other
words could:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;O ye, who consider or declare me to be hostile,
obstinate, or misanthropic, what injustice ye do me! Ye
know not the secret causes of that which to you wears
such an appearance. My heart and my mind were from
childhood prone to the tender feelings of affection. Nay, I
was always disposed even to perform great actions. But,
only consider that, for the last six years, I have been
attacked by an incurable complaint, aggravated by the
unskilful treatment of medical men, disappointed from
year to year in the hope of relief, and at last obliged to
submit to the endurance of an evil the cure of which may
last perhaps for years, if it is practicable at all. Born with
a lively, ardent disposition, susceptible to the diversions of
society, I was forced at an early age to renounce them, and
to pass my life in seclusion. If I strove at any time to set
myself above all this, oh how cruelly was I driven back by
the doubly painful experience of my defective hearing! and
yet it was not possible for me to say to people, &lsquo;Speak
louder&mdash;bawl&mdash;for I am deaf!&rsquo; Ah! how could I proclaim
the defect of a sense that I once possessed in the
highest perfection&mdash;in a perfection in which few of my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
colleagues possess or ever did possess it? Indeed, I cannot!
Forgive me, then, if ye see me draw back when I
would gladly mingle among you. Doubly mortifying is my
misfortune to me, as it must tend to cause me to be
misconceived. From recreation in the society of my
fellow-creatures, from the pleasures of conversation, from
the effusions of friendship, I am cut off. Almost alone in
the world, I dare not venture into society more than
absolute necessity requires. I am obliged to live as an
exile. If I go into company, a painful anxiety comes over
me, since I am apprehensive of being exposed to the danger
of betraying my situation. Such has been my state, too,
during this half year that I have spent in the country.
Enjoined by my intelligent physician to spare my hearing
as much as possible, I have been almost encouraged by him
in my present natural disposition, though, hurried away by
my fondness for society, I sometimes suffered myself to be
enticed into it. But what a humiliation when any one
standing beside me could hear at a distance a flute that I
could not hear, or any one heard the shepherd singing, and
I could not distinguish a sound! Such circumstances
brought me to the brink of despair, and had well-nigh made
me put an end to my life&mdash;nothing but my art held my
hand. Ah! it seemed to me impossible to quit the world
before I had produced all that I felt myself called to
accomplish. And so I endured this wretched life&mdash;so truly
wretched, that a somewhat speedy change is capable of
transporting me from the best into the worst condition.
Patience&mdash;so I am told&mdash;I must choose for my guide.
Steadfast, I hope, will be my resolution to persevere, till it
shall please the inexorable Fates to cut the thread.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps there may be an amendment&mdash;perhaps not; I
am prepared for the worst&mdash;I, who so early as my twenty-eighth
year was forced to become a philosopher&mdash;it is not
easy&mdash;for the artist more difficult than for any other. O
God! thou lookest down upon my misery; thou knowest
that it is accompanied with love of my fellow-creatures, and
a disposition to do good! O men! when ye shall read this,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
think that ye have wronged me; and let the child of affliction
take comfort on finding one like himself, who, in spite
of all the impediments of Nature, yet did all that lay in
his power to obtain admittance into the rank of worthy
artists and men.... I go to meet Death with joy. If he
comes before I have had occasion to develop all my professional
abilities, he will come too soon for me, in spite of
my hard fate, and I should wish that he had delayed his
arrival. But even then I am content, for he will release
me from a state of endless suffering. Come when thou wilt,
I shall meet thee with firmness. Farewell, and do not quite
forget me after I am dead; I have deserved that you should
think of me, for in my lifetime I have often thought of you
to make you happy. May you ever be so!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>The music of Beethoven has left a profound impress on
art. In speaking of his genius it is difficult to keep
expression within the limits of good taste. For who has so
passed into the very inner <i>penetralia</i> of his great art, and
revealed to the world such heights and depths of beauty and
power in sound?</p>

<p>Beethoven composed nine symphonies, which, by one
voice, are ranked as the greatest ever written, reaching in
the last, known as the &ldquo;Choral,&rdquo; the full perfection of his
power and experience. Other musicians have composed
symphonic works remarkable for varied excellences, but in
Beethoven this form of writing seems to have attained
its highest possibilities, and to have been illustrated
by the greatest variety of effects, from the sublime to
such as are simply beautiful and melodious. His hand
swept the whole range of expression with unfaltering
mastery. Some passages may seem obscure, some too
elaborately wrought, some startling and abrupt, but on all
is stamped the die of his great genius.</p>

<p>Beethoven&rsquo;s compositions for the piano, the sonatas, are
no less notable for range and power of expression, their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
adaptation to meet all the varied moods of passion and
sentiment. Other pianoforte composers have given us
more warm and vivid colour, richer sensual effects of tone,
more wild and bizarre combination, perhaps even greater
sweetness in melody; but we look in vain elsewhere for
the spiritual passion and poetry, the aspiration and longing,
the lofty humanity, which make the Beethoven sonatas the
<i>suspiria de profundis</i> of the composer&rsquo;s inner life. In
addition to his symphonies and sonatas, he wrote the great
opera of &ldquo;Fidelio,&rdquo; and in the field of oratorio asserted his
equality with Handel and Haydn by composing &ldquo;The
Mount of Olives.&rdquo; A great variety of chamber music,
masses, and songs bear the same imprint of power. He
may be called the most original and conscientious of all
the composers. Handel, Haydn, Mozart, Schubert, and
Mendelssohn were inveterate thieves, and pilfered the
choicest gems from old and forgotten writers without
scruple. Beethoven seems to have been so fecund in great
conceptions, so lifted on the wings of his tireless genius, so
austere in artistic morality, that he stands for the most
part above the reproach deservedly borne by his brother
composers.</p>

<p>Beethoven&rsquo;s principal title to fame is in his superlative
place as a symphonic composer. In the symphony music
finds its highest intellectual dignity; in Beethoven the
symphony has found its loftiest master.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2><a name="schubert" id="schubert"></a><i>SCHUBERT AND SCHUMANN.</i></h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Heinrich Heine</span>, in his preface to a translation of <i>Don
Quixote</i>, discusses the creative powers of different peoples.
To the Spaniard Cervantes is awarded the first place in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
novel-writing, and to our own Shakespeare, of course, the
transcendent rank in drama.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the Germans,&rdquo; he goes on to say, &ldquo;what palm is
due to them? Well, we are the best writers of songs in the
world. No people possesses such beautiful <i>Lieder</i> as the
Germans. Just at present the nations have too much
political business on hand; but, after that has once been
settled, we Germans, English, Spaniards, Frenchmen, and
Italians will all go to the green forest and sing, and the
nightingale shall be umpire. I feel sure that in this contest
the song of Wolfgang Goethe will gain the prize.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are few, if any, who will be disposed to dispute the
verdict of the German poet, himself no mean rival, in depth
and variety of lyric inspiration, even of the great Goethe.
But a greater poet than either one of this great pair bears
the suggestive and impersonal name of &ldquo;The People.&rdquo; It
is to the countless wealth of the German race in folk-songs,
an affluence which can be traced back to the very dawn of
civilisation among them, that the possibility of such lyric
poets as Goethe, Heine, R&uuml;ckert, and Uhland is due. From
the days of the &ldquo;Nibelungenlied,&rdquo; that great epic which,
like the Homeric poems, can hardly be credited to any one
author, every hamlet has rung with beautiful national
songs, which sprung straight from the fervid heart of
the people. These songs are balmy with the breath of
the forest, the meadow, and river, and have that simple
and bewitching freshness of motive and rhythm which
unconsciously sets itself to music.</p>

<p>The German <i>Volkslied</i>, as the exponent of the popular
heart, has a wide range, from mere comment on historical
events, and quaint, droll satire, such as may be found in
Hans Sachs, to the grand protest against spiritual bondage
which makes the burden of Luther&rsquo;s hymn, &ldquo;Ein&rsquo; feste
Burg.&rdquo; But nowhere is the beauty of the German song so
marked as in those <i>Lieder</i> treating of love, deeds of arms,
and the old mystic legends so dear to the German heart.
Tieck writes of the &ldquo;Minnesinger period&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Believers sang
of faith, lovers of love; knights described knightly actions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
and battles, and loving, believing knights were their chief
audiences. The spring, beauty, gaiety, were objects that
could never tire; great duels and deeds of arms carried away
every hearer, the more surely the stronger they were painted;
and as the pillars and dome of the church encircled the flock,
so did Religion, as the highest, encircle poetry and reality,
and every heart in equal love humbled itself before her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A similar spirit has always inspired the popular German
song, a simple and beautiful reverence for the unknown, the
worship of heroism, a vital sympathy with the various
manifestations of Nature. Without the fire of the French
<i>chansons</i>, the sonorous grace of the Tuscan <i>stornelli</i>, these
artless ditties, with their exclusive reliance on true feeling,
possess an indescribable charm.</p>

<p>The German <i>Lied</i> always preserved its characteristic
beauty. Goethe, and the great school of lyric poets clustered
around him, simply perfected the artistic form, without
departing from the simplicity and soulfulness of the stock
from which it came. Had it not been for the rich soil of
popular song, we should not have had the peerless lyrics of
modern Germany. Had it not been for the poetic inspiration
of such word-makers as Goethe and Heine, we should not
have had such music-makers in the sphere of song as Schubert
and Franz.</p>

<p>The songs of these masters appeal to the interest and
admiration of the world, then, not merely in virtue of musical
beauty, but in that they are the most vital outgrowths of
Teutonic nationality and feeling.</p>

<p>The immemorial melodies to which the popular songs of
Germany were set display great simplicity of rhythm, even
monotony, with frequent recurrence of the minor keys, so
well adapted to express the melancholy tone of many of the
poems. The strictly strophic treatment is used, or, in other
words, the repetition of the melody of the first stanza in all
the succeeding ones. The chasm between this and the
varied form of the artistic modern song is deep and wide,
yet it was overleaped in a single swift bound by the remarkable
genius of Franz Schubert, who, though his compositions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
were many and matchless of their kind, died all too young;
for, as the inscription on his tombstone pathetically has it,
he was &ldquo;rich in what he gave, richer in what he promised.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The great masters of the last century tried their hands in
the domain of song with only comparative success, partly
because they did not fully realise the nature of this form
of art, partly because they could not limit the sweep of the
creative power within such narrow limits. Schubert was a
revelation to his countrymen in his musical treatment of
subjective passion, in his instinctive command over condensed,
epigrammatic expression. This rich and gifted life,
however quiet in its exterior facts, was great in its creative
and spiritual manifestation. Born at Vienna of humble
parents, January 31, 1797, the early life of Franz Schubert
was commonplace in the extreme, the most interesting
feature being the extraordinary development of his genius.
At the age of fourteen he had made himself a master of
counterpoint and harmony, and composed a large mass of
chamber-music and works for the piano. His poverty was
such that he was oftentimes unable to obtain the music-paper
with which to fasten the immortal thoughts that
thronged through his brain. It was two years later that
his special creative function found exercise in the production
of the two great songs, the &ldquo;Erl-King&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Serenade,&rdquo; the former of which proved the source of most
of the fame and money emolument he enjoyed during life.
It is hardly needful to speak of the power and beauty of
this composition, the weird sweetness of its melodies, the
dramatic contrasts, the wealth of colour and shading in its
varying phrases, the subtilty of the accompaniment, which
elaborates the spirit of the song itself. The piece was
composed in less than an hour. One of Schubert&rsquo;s
intimates tells us that he left him reading Goethe&rsquo;s great
poem for the first time. He instantly conceived and
arranged the melody, and when the friend returned after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
a short absence Schubert was rapidly noting the music
from his head on paper. When the song was finished he
rushed to the Stadtconvict school, his only <i>alma mater</i>, and
sang it to the scholars. The music-master, Rucziszka, was
overwhelmed with rapture and astonishment, and embraced
the young composer in a transport of joy. When this
immortal music was first sung to Goethe, the great poet
said, &ldquo;Had music, instead of words, been my instrument
of thought, it is so I would have framed the legend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Serenade&rdquo; is another example of the swiftness of
Schubert&rsquo;s artistic imagination. He and a lot of jolly
boon-companions sat one Sunday afternoon in an obscure
Viennese tavern, known as the Biersack. The surroundings
were anything but conducive to poetic fancies&mdash;dirty
tables, floor, and ceiling, the clatter of mugs and dishes, the
loud dissonance of the beery German roisterers, the
squalling of children, and all the sights and noises characteristic
of the beer-cellar. One of our composer&rsquo;s
companions had a volume of poems, which Schubert
looked at in a lazy way, laughing and drinking the while.
Singling out some verses, he said, &ldquo;I have a pretty melody
in my head for these lines, if I could only get a piece of
ruled paper.&rdquo; Some staves were drawn on the back of a
bill-of-fare, and here, amid all the confusion and riot, the
divine melody of the &ldquo;Serenade&rdquo; was born, a tone-poem
which embodies the most delicate dream of passion and
tenderness that the heart of man ever conceived.</p>

<p>Both these compositions were eccentric and at odds with
the old canons of song, fancied with a grace, warmth, and
variety of colour hitherto characteristic only of the more
pretentious forms of music, which had already been brought
to a great degree of perfection. They inaugurate the genesis
of the new school of musical lyrics, the golden wedding of
the union of poetry with music.</p>

<p>For a long time the young composer was unsuccessful in
his attempts to break through the barren and irritating
drudgery of a schoolmaster&rsquo;s life. At last a wealthy young
dilettante, Franz von Schober, who had become an admirer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
of Schubert&rsquo;s songs, persuaded his mother to offer him a
fixed home in her house. The latter gratefully accepted
the overture of friendship, and thence became a daily guest
at Schober&rsquo;s house. He made at this time a number of
strong friendships with obscure poets, whose names only
live through the music of the composer set to verses
furnished by them; for Schubert, in his affluence of creative
power, merely needed the slightest excuse for his genius to
flow forth. But, while he wrote nothing that was not
beautiful, his masterpieces are based only on themes
furnished by the lyrics of such poets as Goethe, Heine, and
R&uuml;ckert. It is related, in connection with his friendship
with Mayrhofer, one of his rhyming associates of these
days, that he would set the verses to music much faster
than the other could compose them.</p>

<p>The songs of the obscure Schubert were gradually finding
their way to favour among the exclusive circles of Viennese
aristocracy. A celebrated singer of the opera, Vogl, though
then far advanced in years, was much sought after for the
drawing-room concerts so popular in Vienna, on account of
the beauty of his art. Vogl was a warm admirer of
Schubert&rsquo;s genius, and devoted himself assiduously to the
task of interpreting it&mdash;a friendly office of no little value.
Had it not been for this, our composer would have sunk to
his early grave probably without even the small share of
reputation and monetary return actually vouchsafed to him.
The strange, dreamy unconsciousness of Schubert is very
well illustrated in a story told by Vogl after his friend&rsquo;s
death. One day Schubert left a new song at the singer&rsquo;s
apartments, which, being too high, was transposed. Vogl,
a fortnight afterwards, sang it in the lower key to his
friend, who remarked: &ldquo;Really, that <i>Lied</i> is not bad; who
composed it?&rdquo;</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Our great composer, from the peculiar constitution of
his gifts, the passionate subjectiveness of his nature, might
be supposed to have been peculiarly sensitive to the fascinations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
of love, for it is in this feeling that lyric inspiration
has found its most fruitful root. But not so. Warmly
susceptible to the charms of friendship, Schubert for the
most part enacted the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of the woman-hater, which was
not all affected; for the Hamlet-like mood is only in part a
simulated madness with souls of this type. In early youth
he would sneer at the amours of his comrades. It is true
he fell a victim to the charms of Theresa Gr&ouml;be, a beautiful
soprano, who afterwards became the spouse of a master-baker.
But the only genuine love-sickness of Schubert was
of a far different type, and left indelible traces on his
nature, as its very direction made it of necessity unfortunate.
This was his attachment to Countess Caroline
Esterhazy.</p>

<p>The Count Esterhazy, one of those great feudal princes
still extant among the Austrian nobility, took a traditional
pride in encouraging genius, and found in Franz Schubert a
noble object for his generous patronage. He was almost a
boy (only nineteen), except in the prodigious development
of his genius, when he entered the Esterhazy family as
teacher of music, though always treated as a dear and
familiar friend. During the summer months, Schubert
went with the Esterhazys to their country seat at Zel&eacute;sz, in
Hungary. Here, amid beautiful scenery, and the sweetness
of a social life perfect of its kind, our poet&rsquo;s life flew on
rapid wings, the one bright, green spot of unalloyed
happiness, for the dream was delicious while it lasted.
Here, too, his musical life gathered a fresh inspiration,
since he became acquainted with the treasures of the
national Hungarian music, with its weird, wild rhythms
and striking melodies. He borrowed the motives of many
of his most characteristic songs from these reminiscences
of hut and hall, for the Esterhazys were royal in their
hospitality, and exercised a wide patriarchal sway.</p>

<p>The beautiful Countess Caroline, an enthusiastic girl of
great beauty, became the object of a romantic passion. A
young, inexperienced maiden, full of <i>na&iuml;ve</i> sweetness, the
finest flower of the haughty Austrian caste, she stood at an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
infinite distance from Schubert, while she treated him
with childlike confidence and fondness, laughing at his
eccentricities, and worshipping his genius. He bowed before
this idol, and poured out all the incense of his heart.
Schubert&rsquo;s exterior was anything but that of the ideal lover.
Rude, unshapely features, thick nose, coarse, protruding
mouth, and a shambling, awkward figure, were redeemed
only by eyes of uncommon splendour and depth, aflame
with the unmistakable light of the soul.</p>

<p>The inexperienced maiden hardly understood the devotion
of the artist, which found expression in a thousand ways
peculiar to himself. Only once he was on the verge of a
full revelation. She asked him why he had dedicated
nothing to her. With abrupt, passionate intensity of tone
Schubert answered, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of that? Everything
belongs to you!&rdquo; This brink of confession seems to have
frightened him, for it is said that after this he threw much
more reserve about his intercourse with the family, till it
was broken off. Hints in his letters, and the deep
despondency which increased after this, indicate, however,
that the humbly-born genius never forgot his beautiful
dream.</p>

<p>He continued to pour out in careless profusion songs,
symphonies, quartets, and operas, many of which knew no
existence but in the score till after his death, hardly
knowing of himself whether the productions had value or
not. He created because it was the essential law of his
being, and never paused to contemplate or admire the
beauties of his own work. Schubert&rsquo;s body had been
mouldering for several years, when his wonderful symphony
in C&nbsp;major, one of the <i>chefs-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i> of orchestral composition,
was brought to the attention of the world by the
critical admiration of Robert Schumann, who won the
admiration of lovers of music, not less by his prompt
vindication of neglected genius than by his own creative
powers.</p>

<p>In the contest between Weber and Rossini which
agitated Vienna, Schubert, though deeply imbued with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
seriousness of art, and by nature closely allied in sympathies
with the composer of &ldquo;Der Freisch&uuml;tz,&rdquo; took no part. He
was too easy-going to become a volunteer partisan, too shy
and obscure to make his alliance a thing to be sought after.
Besides, Weber had treated him with great brusqueness,
and damned an opera for him, a slight which even good-natured
Franz Schubert could not easily forgive.</p>

<p>The fifteen operas of Schubert, unknown now except to
musicians, contain a wealth of beautiful melody which
could easily be spread over a score of ordinary works. The
purely lyric impulse so dominated him that dramatic
arrangement was lost sight of, and the noblest melodies
were likely to be lavished on the most unworthy situations.
Even under the operatic form he remained essentially the
song-writer. So in the symphony his affluence of melodic
inspiration seems actually to embarrass him, to the detriment
of that breadth and symmetry of treatment so vital
to this form of art. It is in the musical lyric that our
composer stands matchless.</p>

<p>During his life as an independent musician at Vienna,
Schubert lived fighting a stern battle with want and
despondency, while the publishers were commencing to
make fortunes by the sale of his exquisite <i>Lieder</i>. At that
time a large source of income for the Viennese composers
was the public performance of their works in concerts under
their own direction. From recourse to this, Schubert&rsquo;s
bashfulness and lack of skill as a <i>virtuoso</i> on any instrument
helped to bar him, though he accompanied his own songs
with exquisite effect. Once only his friends organised a
concert for him, and the success was very brilliant. But he
was prevented from repeating the good fortune by that fatal
illness which soon set in. So he lived out the last glimmers
of his life, poverty-stricken, despondent, with few even of
the amenities of friendship to soothe his declining days.
Yet those who know the beautiful results of that life, and
have even a faint glow of sympathy with the life of a man
of genius, will exclaim with one of the most eloquent
critics of Schubert&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
&ldquo;But shall we, therefore, pity a man who all the while revelled in
the treasures of his creative ore, and from the very depths of whose
despair sprang the sweetest flowers of song? Who would not battle
with the iciest blast of the north if out of storm and snow he could
bring back to his chamber the germs of the &lsquo;Winterreise?&rsquo; Who
would grudge the moisture of his eyes if he could render it immortal
in the strains of Schubert&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lob der Thr&auml;ne?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Schubert died in the flower of his youth, November 19,
1828; but he left behind him nearly a thousand compositions,
six hundred of which were songs. Of his operas only
the &ldquo;Enchanted Harp&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rosamond&rdquo; were put on the
stage during his lifetime. &ldquo;Fierabras,&rdquo; considered to be his
finest dramatic work, has never been produced. His church
music, consisting of six masses, many offertories, and the
great &ldquo;Hallelujah&rdquo; of Klopstock, is still performed in
Germany. Several of his symphonies are ranked among the
greatest works of this nature. His pianoforte compositions
are brilliant, and strongly in the style of Beethoven, who
was always the great object of Schubert&rsquo;s devoted admiration,
his artistic idol and model. It was his dying request
that he should be buried by the side of Beethoven, of whom
the art-world had been deprived the year before.</p>

<p>Compared with Schubert, other composers seem to have
written in prose. His imagination burned with a passionate
love of Nature. The lakes, the woods, the mountain
heights, inspired him with eloquent reveries that burst into
song; but he always saw Nature through the medium of
human passion and sympathy, which transfigured it. He
was the faithful interpreter of spiritual suffering, and the
joy which is born thereof.</p>

<p>The genius of Schubert seems to have been directly formed
for the expression of subjective emotion in music. That his
life should have been simultaneous with the perfect literary
unfolding of the old <i>Volkslied</i> in the superb lyrics of Goethe,
Heine, and their school, is quite remarkable. Poetry and
song clasped hands on the same lofty summits of genius.
Liszt has given to our composer the title of <i>le musicien le
plus po&eacute;tique</i>, which very well expresses his place in art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
In the song as created by Schubert and transmitted to his
successors, there are three forms, the first of which is that
of the simple <i>Lied</i>, with one unchanged melody. A good
example of this is the setting of Goethe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Haider&ouml;slein,&rdquo;
which is full of quaint grace and simplicity. A second and
more elaborate method is what the Germans call &ldquo;through-composed,&rdquo;
in which all the different feelings are successively
embodied in the changes of the melody, the sense of unity
being preserved by the treatment of the accompaniment, or
the recurrence of the principal motive at the close of the
song. Two admirable models of this are found in the
&ldquo;Lindenbaum&rdquo; and &ldquo;Serenade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The third and finest art-method, as applied by Schubert
to lyric music, is the &ldquo;declamatory.&rdquo; In this form we
detect the consummate flower of the musical lyric. The
vocal part is lifted into a species of passionate chant, full
of dramatic fire and colour, while the accompaniment,
which is extremely elaborate, furnishes a most picturesque
setting. The genius of the composer displays itself here
fully as much as in the vocal treatment. When the lyric
feeling rises to its climax it expresses itself in the crowning
melody, this high tide of the music and poetry being always
in unison. As masterpieces of this form may be cited
&ldquo;Die Stadt&rdquo; and &ldquo;Der Erlk&ouml;nig,&rdquo; which stand far beyond
any other works of the same nature in the literature of
music.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert Schumann</span>, the loving critic, admirer, and
disciple of Schubert in the province of song, was in most
respects a man of far different type. The son of a man of
wealth and position, his mind and tastes were cultivated
from early youth with the utmost care. Schumann is
known in Germany no less as a philosophical thinker and
critic than as a composer. As the editor of the <i>Neue
Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Musik</i>, he exercised a powerful influence
over contemporary thought in art-matters, and established
himself both as a keen and incisive thinker and as a master
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
of literary style. Schumann was at first intended for the
law, but his unconquerable taste for music asserted itself
in spite of family opposition. His acquaintance with the
celebrated teacher, Wieck, whose gifted daughter, Clara,
afterwards became his wife, finally established his career;
for it was through Wieck&rsquo;s advice that the Schumann
family yielded their opposition to the young man&rsquo;s bent.</p>

<p>Once settled in his new career, Schumann gave himself
up to work with the most indefatigable ardour. The early
part of the present century was a halcyon time for the
<i>virtuosi</i>, and the fame and wealth that poured themselves
on such players as Paganini and Liszt made such a pursuit
tempting in the extreme. Fortunately, the young musician
was saved from such a career. In his zeal of practice and
desire to attain a perfectly independent action for each
finger on the piano, Schumann devised some machinery,
the result of which was to weaken the sinews of his third
finger by undue distension. By this he lost the effective
use of the whole right hand, and of course his career as a
<i>virtuoso</i> practically closed.</p>

<p>Music gained in its higher walks what it lost in a lower.
Schumann devoted himself to composition and &aelig;sthetic
criticism, after he had passed through a thorough course of
preparatory studies. Both as a writer and a composer
Schumann fought against Philistinism in music. Ardent,
progressive, and imaginative, he soon became the leader of
the romantic school, and inaugurated the crusade which had
its parallel in France in that carried on by Victor Hugo in
the domain of poetry. His early pianoforte compositions
bear the strong impress of this fiery, revolutionary spirit.
His great symphonic works belong to a later period, when
his whole nature had mellowed and ripened without losing
its imaginative sweep and brilliancy. Schumann&rsquo;s compositions
for the piano and orchestra are those by which
his name is most widely honoured, but nowhere do we
find a more characteristic exercise of his genius than in
his songs, to which this article will call more special
attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
Such works as the &ldquo;&Eacute;tudes Symphoniques&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Kreisleriana&rdquo; express much of the spirit of unrest and
longing aspiration, the struggle to get away from prison-bars
and limits, which seem to have sounded the key-note
of Schumann&rsquo;s deepest nature. But these feelings could
only find their fullest outlet in the musical form expressly
suited to subjective emotion. Accordingly, the &ldquo;Sturm
and Drang&rdquo; epoch of his life, when all his thoughts and
conceptions were most unsettled and visionary, was most
fruitful in lyric song. In Heinrich Heine he found a fitting
poetical co-worker, in whose moods he seemed to see a
perfect reflection of his own&mdash;Heine, in whom the bitterest
irony was wedded to the deepest pathos, &ldquo;the spoiled
favourite of the Graces,&rdquo; &ldquo;the knight with the laughing
tear in his scutcheon&rdquo;&mdash;Heine, whose songs are charged
with the brightest light and deepest gloom of the human
heart.</p>

<p>Schumann&rsquo;s songs never impress us as being deliberate
attempts at creative effort, consciously selected forms
through which to express thoughts struggling for speech.
They are rather involuntary experiments to relieve oneself
of some woeful burden, medicine for the soul. Schumann is
never distinctively the lyric composer; his imagination had
too broad and majestic a wing. But in those moods, peculiar
to genius, where the soul is flung back on itself with a
sense of impotence, our composer instinctively burst into
song. He did not in the least advance or change its
artistic form, as fixed by Schubert. This, indeed, would
have been irreconcilable with his use of the song as a simple
medium of personal feeling, an outlet and safeguard.</p>

<p>The peculiar place of Schumann as a song-writer is
indicated by his being called the musical exponent of Heine,
who seems to be the other half of his soul. The composer
enters into each shade and detail of the poet&rsquo;s meaning with
an intensity and fidelity which one can never cease admiring.
It is this phase which gives the Schumann songs their
great artistic value. In their clean-cut, abrupt, epigrammatic
force there is something different from the work of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
any other musical lyrist. So much has this impressed the
students of the composer that more than one able critic has
ventured to prophesy that Schumann&rsquo;s greatest claim to
immortality would yet be found in such works as the settings
of &ldquo;Ich grolle nicht&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Dichterliebe&rdquo; series&mdash;a
perverted estimate, perhaps, but with a large substratum
of truth. The duration of Schumann&rsquo;s song-time was short,
the greater part of his <i>Lieder</i> having been written in 1840.
After this he gave himself up to oratorio, symphony, and
chamber-music.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Note by the Editor.</span>&mdash;The above account of Robert Schumann
does not give an adequate impression of the composer; the following
remarks are therefore appended, based in most part upon J.&nbsp;A. Fuller
Maitland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Schumann&rdquo; in <i>The Great Musicians</i> Series. In 1832
the poet Grillparzer, in a critical article published in the <i>Wiener
Musikalische Zeitung</i>, recognises that Schumann &ldquo;belongs to no
school, but creates of himself without making parade of outlandish
ideas, ... he has made himself a new ideal world in which
he moves about as he wills, with a certain original <i>bizarrerie</i>.&rdquo;
Moscheles, a friend of Schumann, wrote in his diary&mdash;&ldquo;For mind
(Geist) give me Schumann. The Romanticism in his works is a
thing so completely new, his genius so great, that to weigh correctly
the peculiar qualities and weakness of this new school
I must go deeper and deeper into the study of his works.&rdquo; In the
<i>Gazette Musicale</i> for November 12, 1837, Franz Liszt wrote a
thoroughly sympathetic criticism of the composer&rsquo;s works, as a whole,
and says&mdash;&ldquo;The more closely we examine Schumann&rsquo;s ideas, the more
power and life do we discover in them; and the more we study them,
the more we are amazed at the wealth and fertility which had before
escaped us.&rdquo; And Hector Berlioz, the great French Romanticist,
looked upon him &ldquo;as one of the most remarkable composers and
critics in Germany.&rdquo; As a musical critic Schumann ranks very high.
In 1834 he, with several friends, started a critical paper, <i>Neue
Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Music</i>, in order &ldquo;no longer to look on idly, but to try
and make things better, so that the poetry of art may once more
be duly honoured.&rdquo; The paper was very successful, and had a
considerable influence in the musical world&mdash;more especially as it
supplied a distinct want, for at the time of its appearance &ldquo;musical
criticism in Germany was of the most futile kind, silly, superficial
admiration of mediocrity&mdash;Schumann used to call it &lsquo;Honey-daubing&rsquo;&mdash;or
the contemptuous depreciation of what was new or unknown;
these were the order of the day in such of the journals as deigned to
notice music at all.&rdquo; Schumann possessed all the qualities which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
required in a musical critic, and it is said of him that in that capacity
he has never been excelled. His aims were high and pure&mdash;to quote
his own words, &ldquo;to send light into the depth of the human heart&mdash;that
is the artist&rsquo;s calling,&rdquo;&mdash;and the chief object of his
critical labour was &ldquo;the elevation of German taste and intellect
by German art, whether by pointing to the great models of
old time, or by encouraging younger talents.&rdquo; His connection
with the paper lasted ten years as a constant contributor, though
he continued to write for it from time to time. The last article published
by him in it was one written in favour of Johannes Brahms, who
had been sent to him with a letter of introduction by Joseph Joachim,
the violinist, &ldquo;recommending to his notice a young composer of whose
powers the writer had formed the highest opinion.&rdquo; &ldquo;At once
Schumann recognised the surpassing capabilities of the young man,
and wrote to Joachim these words, and nothing more&mdash;&lsquo;Das ist der,
der kommen musste&rsquo; (&lsquo;This is he was wanted to come&rsquo;).&rdquo; The
article was entitled &ldquo;New Paths,&rdquo; and is one of his most remarkable
writings. &ldquo;In it Schumann seems to sing his &lsquo;Nunc Dimittis,&rsquo; hailing
the advent of this young and ardent spirit, who was to carry on the
great line of composers, and to prove himself no unworthy member of
their glorious company.&rdquo; The concluding sentence of the article,
which contained the composer&rsquo;s last printed words, is not a little
remarkable, for it gives fullest expression to that principle which had
always governed his own criticism. &ldquo;In every age there is a secret
band of kindred spirits. Ye who are of this fellowship, see that ye
weld the circle firmly, so that the truth of art may shine ever more
and more clearly, shedding joy and blessing far and near.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a man Schumann was kind-hearted, generous, devoid of jealousy,
and always ready and willing to recognise merit, great or small, in
those with whom he came in contact. It was always easier for him to
praise than to blame; so much so that in conducting an orchestra in
rehearsal, it became impossible for him to find fault with the performers
when necessity arose, and, if they did not find out their mistakes
themselves, he allowed them to remain uncorrected! Although a
faithful friend, he was eminently unsociable; he was very reserved and
silent, and this peculiarity became more marked towards the latter
part of his life, when his terrible malady was spreading its shadow
over him. An amusing account of his silence is given in E. Hanslick&rsquo;s
<i>Musikalischen Stationen</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Wagner expressed himself thus to the
author in 1846&mdash;&lsquo;Schumann is a highly gifted musician, but an
<em>impossible</em> man. When I came from Paris I went to see Schumann; I
related to him my Parisian experiences, spoke of the state of music in
France, then of that in Germany, spoke of literature and politics; but
he remained as good as dumb for nearly an hour. One cannot
go on talking quite alone. An impossible man!&rsquo;&rdquo; Schumann&rsquo;s
account, apparently of the same interview, is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;I have
seldom met him; but he is a man of education and spirit; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
talks, however, unceasingly, and that one cannot endure for very
long together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Schumann has been described &ldquo;as a man of moderately tall stature,
well-built, and of a dignified and pleasant aspect. The outlines of his
face, with its intellectual brow, and with its lower part inclining
slightly to heaviness, are sufficiently familiar to us all; but
we cannot see the dreamy, half-shut eyes kindle into animation at a
word from some friend with whom he felt himself in sympathy.&rdquo; A
description of him by his friend, Sterndale Bennett, is amusing, on
the words of which S. Bennett wrote a little canon&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Schumann&rsquo;s latter days were very sorrowful, for he was afflicted with a
great mental distress, caused, we are told by one of his biographers, by
ossification of the brain. He was haunted by delusions&mdash;amongst
others, by the constant hearing of a single musical note. &ldquo;On one
occasion he was under the impression that Schubert and Mendelssohn
had visited him, and had given him a musical theme, which he wrote
down, and upon which he set himself to write variations.&rdquo; He suffered
from attacks of acute melancholy, and at length, during one of them,
threw himself into the Rhine, but was, fortunately, rescued. At length
it became necessary to confine him in a private asylum, where he was
visited by his friends when his condition permitted it. He died on
July 29, 1856, in presence of his wife, through whose exertions, in great
part, we, in England, have become acquainted with his pianoforte
works.</p>

<h2><a name="chopin" id="chopin"></a><i>CHOPIN.</i></h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Never</span> has Paris, the Mecca of European art, genius, and
culture, presented a more brilliant social spectacle than it
did in 1832. Hitherward came pilgrims from all countries,
poets, painters, and musicians, anxious to breathe the inspiring
air of the French capital, where society laid its
warmest homage at the feet of the artist. Here came, too,
in dazzling crowds, the rich nobles and the beautiful women
of Europe to find the pleasure, the freedom, the joyous unrestraint,
with which Paris offers its banquet of sensuous
and intellectual delights to the hungry epicure. Then as
now the queen of the art-world, Paris absorbed and
assimilated to herself the most brilliant influences in
civilisation.</p>

<p>In all of brilliant Paris there was no more charming and
gifted circle than that which gathered around the young
Polish pianist and composer, Chopin, then a recent arrival
in the gay city. His peculiarly original genius, his weird
and poetic style of playing, which transported his hearers
into a mystic fairy-land of sunlight and shadow, his strangely
delicate beauty, the alternating reticence and enthusiasm of
his manners, made him the idol of the clever men and
women, who courted the society of the shy and sensitive
musician; for to them he was a fresh revelation. Dr. Franz
Liszt gives the world some charming pictures of this art-coterie,
which was wont often to assemble at Chopin&rsquo;s
rooms in the Chauss&eacute;e d&rsquo;Antin.</p>

<p>His room, taken by surprise, is all in darkness except the
luminous ring thrown off by the candles on the piano, and
the flashes flickering from the fire-place. The guests gather
around informally as the piano sighs, moans, murmurs, or
dreams under the fingers of the player. Heinrich Heine,
the most poetic of humorists, leans on the instrument, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
asks, as he listens to the music and watches the firelight,
&ldquo;if the roses always glowed with a flame so triumphant? if
the trees at moonlight sang always so harmoniously?&rdquo;
Meyerbeer, one of the musical giants, sits near at hand lost
in reverie; for he forgets his own great harmonies, forged
with hammer of Cyclops, listening to the dreamy passion
and poetry woven into such quaint fabrics of sound.
Adolphe Nourrit, passionate and ascetic, with the spirit of
some medi&aelig;val monastic painter, an enthusiastic servant of
art in its purest, severest form, a combination of poet and
anchorite, is also there; for he loves the gentle musician,
who seems to be a visitor from the world of spirits. Eug&egrave;ne
Delacroix, one of the greatest of modern painters, his keen
eyes half closed in meditation, absorbs the vague mystery of
colour which imagination translates from the harmony, and
attains new insight and inspiration through the bright links
of suggestion by which one art lends itself to another.
The two great Polish poets, Niemcewicz and Mickiewicz
(the latter the Dante of the Slavic race), exiles from their
unhappy land, feed their sombre sorrow, and find in the
wild, Oriental rhythms of the player only melancholy
memories of the past. Perhaps Victor Hugo, Balzac,
Lamartine, or the aged Chateaubriand, also drop in by-and-by,
to recognise, in the music, echoes of the daring
romanticism which they opposed to the classic and formal
pedantry of the time.</p>

<p>Buried in a fauteuil, with her arms resting upon a table,
sits Mdme. George Sand (that name so tragically mixed with
Chopin&rsquo;s life), &ldquo;curiously attentive, gracefully subdued.&rdquo;
With the second sight of genius, which pierces through the
mask, she saw the sweetness, the passion, the delicate
emotional sensibility of Chopin; and her insatiate nature
must unravel and assimilate this new study in human enjoyment
and suffering. She had then just finished &ldquo;Lelia,&rdquo;
that strange and powerful creation, in which she embodied
all her hatred of the forms and tyrannies of society, her
craving for an impossible social ideal, her tempestuous
hopes and desires, in such startling types. Exhausted by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
the struggle, she panted for the rest and luxury of a companionship
in which both brain and heart could find
sympathy. She met Chopin, and she recognised in the
poetry of his temperament and the fire of his genius what
she desired. Her personality, electric, energetic, and imperious,
exercised the power of a magnet on the frail
organisation of Chopin, and he loved once and forever,
with a passion that consumed him; for in Mdme. Sand he
found the blessing and curse of his life. This many-sided
woman, at this point of her development, found in the fragile
Chopin one phase of her nature which had never been expressed,
and he was sacrificed to the demands of an insatiable
originality, which tried all things in turn, to be contented
with nothing but an ideal which could never be attained.</p>

<p>About the time of Chopin&rsquo;s arrival in Paris the political
effervescence of the recent revolution had passed into art
and letters. It was the oft-repeated battle of Romanticism
against Classicism. There could be no truce between those
who believed that everything must be fashioned after old
models, that Procrustes must settle the height and depth,
the length and breadth of art-forms, and those who, inspired
with the new wine of liberty and free creative thought, held
that the rule of form should always be the mere expression
of the vital, flexible thought. The one side argued that
supreme perfection already reached left the artist hope only
in imitation; the other, that the immaterial beautiful could
have no fixed absolute form. Victor Hugo among the
poets, Delacroix among the painters, and Berlioz among
the musicians, led the ranks of the romantic school.</p>

<p>Chopin found himself strongly enlisted in this contest on
the side of the new school. His free, unconventional
nature found in its teachings a musical atmosphere true to
the artistic and political proclivities of his native Poland;
for Chopin breathed the spirit and tendencies of his people
in every fibre of his soul, both as man and artist. Our
musician, however, in freeing himself from all servile formulas,
sternly repudiated the charlatanism which would
replace old abuses with new ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
Chopin, in his views of his art, did not admit the least
compromise with those who failed earnestly to represent
progress, nor, on the other hand, with those who sought to
make their art a mere profitable trade. With him, as with
all the great musicians, his art was a religion&mdash;something so
sacred that it must be approached with unsullied heart and
hand. This reverential feeling was shown in the following
touching fact:&mdash;It was a Polish custom to choose the garments
in which one would be buried. Chopin, though
among the first of contemporary artists, gave fewer concerts
than any other; but, notwithstanding this, he left directions
to be borne to the grave in the clothes he had worn on such
occasions.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Frederick Francis Chopin</span> was born near Warsaw, in
1810, of French extraction. He learned music at the age
of nine from Ziwny, a pupil of Sebastian Bach, but does not
seem to have impressed anyone with his remarkable talent
except Madame Catalani, the great singer, who gave him a
watch. Through the kindness of Prince Radziwill, an
enthusiastic patron of art, he was sent to Warsaw College,
where his genius began to unfold itself. He afterwards
became a pupil of the Warsaw Conservatory, and acquired
there a splendid mastery over the science of music. His
labour was prodigious in spite of his frail health; and his
knowledge of contrapuntal forms was such as to exact the
highest encomiums from his instructors.</p>

<p>Through his brother pupils he was introduced to the
highest Polish society, for his fellows bore some of the
proudest names in Poland. Chopin seems to have absorbed
the peculiarly romantic spirit of his race, the wild, imaginative
melancholy, which, almost gloomy in the Polish peasant,
when united to grace and culture in the Polish noble,
offered an indescribable social charm. Balzac sketches the
Polish woman in these picturesque antitheses:&mdash;&ldquo;Angel
through love, demon through fantasy; child through faith,
sage through experience; man through the brain, woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
through the heart; giant through hope, mother through
sorrow; and poet through dreams.&rdquo; The Polish gentleman
was chivalrous, daring, and passionate; the heir of the most
gifted and brilliant of the Slavic races, with a proud heritage
of memory which gave his bearing an indescribable dignity,
though the son of a fallen nation. Ardently devoted to
pleasure, the Poles embodied in their national dances wild
and inspiring rhythms, a glowing poetry of sentiment as
well as motion, which mingled with their Bacchanal fire a
chaste and lofty meaning that became at times funereal.
Polish society at this epoch pulsated with an originality, an
imagination, and a romance, which transfigured even the
common things of life.</p>

<p>It was amid such an atmosphere that Chopin&rsquo;s early
musical career was spent, and his genius received its lasting
impress. One afternoon in after years he was playing to
one of the most distinguished women in Paris, and she said
that his music suggested to her those gardens in Turkey
where bright parterres of flowers and shady bowers were
strewed with gravestones and burial mounds. This underlying
depth of melancholy Chopin&rsquo;s music expresses most
eloquently, and it may be called the perfect artistic outcome
of his people; for in his sweetest tissues of sound the
imagination can detect agitation, rancour, revolt, and
menace, sometimes despair. Chateaubriand dreamed of
an Eve innocent, yet fallen; ignorant of all, yet knowing all;
mistress, yet virgin. He found this in a Polish girl of
seventeen, whom he paints as a &ldquo;mixture of Odalisque and
Valkyr.&rdquo; The romantic and fanciful passion of the Poles,
bold, yet unworldly, is shown in the habit of drinking the
health of a sweetheart from her own shoe.</p>

<p>Chopin, intensely spiritual by temperament and fragile in
health, born an enthusiast, was coloured through and through
with the rich dyes of Oriental passion; but with these were
mingled the fantastic and ideal elements which,</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Wrapped in sense, yet dreamed of heavenlier joys.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And so he went to Paris, the city of his fate, ripe for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
tragedy of his life. After the revolution of 1830, he started
to go to London, and, as he said, &ldquo;passed through Paris.&rdquo;
Yet Paris he did not leave till he left it with Mdme. Sand to
live a brief dream of joy in the beautiful Isle of Majorca.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Liszt describes Chopin in these words&mdash;&ldquo;His blue eyes
were more spiritual than dreamy; his bland smile never
writhed into bitterness. The transparent delicacy of his complexion
pleased the eye; his fair hair was soft and silky; his
nose slightly aquiline; his bearing so distinguished, and his
manners stamped with such high breeding, that involuntarily
he was always treated <i>en prince</i>. His gestures were many and
graceful; the tones of his voiced veiled, often stifled. His
stature was low, his limbs were slight.&rdquo; Again, Mdme.
Sand paints him even more characteristically in her novel,
<i>Lucrezia Floriani</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Gentle, sensitive, and very lovely, he
united the charm of adolescence with the suavity of a more
mature age; through the want of muscular development he
retained a peculiar beauty, an exceptional physiognomy,
which, if we may venture so to speak, belonged to neither
age nor sex.... It was more like the ideal creations with
which the poetry of the Middle Ages adorned the Christian
temples. The delicacy of his constitution rendered him
interesting in the eyes of women. The full yet graceful
cultivation of his mind, the sweet and captivating originality
of his conversation, gained for him the attention of the most
enlightened men; while those less highly cultivated liked
him for the exquisite courtesy of his manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this reminds us of Shelley&rsquo;s dream of Hermaphroditus,
or perhaps of Shelley himself, for Chopin was the Shelley of
music.</p>

<p>His life in Paris was quiet and retired. The most brilliant
and beautiful women desired to be his pupils, but Chopin refused
except where he recognised in the petitioners exceptional
earnestness and musical talent. He gave but few concerts,
for his genius could not cope with great masses of people.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
He said to Liszt, &ldquo;I am not suited for concert-giving.
The public intimidate me, their breath stifles me. You are
destined for it; for when you do not gain your public, you
have the force to assault, to overwhelm, to compel them.&rdquo;
It was his delight to play to a few chosen friends, and to
evoke for them such dreams from the ivory gate, which
Virgil fabled to be the portal of Elysium, as to make his
music</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The silver key of the fountain of tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where the spirit drinks till the brain is wild;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Softest grave of a thousand fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where their mother, Care, like a weary child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is laid asleep in a bed of flowers.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He avoided general society, finding in the great artists
and those sympathetic with art his congenial companions.
His life was given up to producing those unique compositions
which make him, <i>par excellence</i>, the king of the
pianoforte. He was recognised by Liszt, Kalkbrenner,
Pleyel, Field, and Meyerbeer, as being the most wonderful
of players; yet he seemed to disdain such a reputation as a
cheap notoriety, ceasing to appear in public after the first
few concerts, which produced much excitement and would
have intoxicated most performers. He sought largely the
society of the Polish exiles, men and women of the highest
rank who had thronged to Paris.</p>

<p>His sister Louise, whom he dearly loved, frequently came
to Paris from Warsaw to see him; and he kept up a regular
correspondence with his own family. Yet he abhorred
writing so much that he would go to any shifts to avoid
answering a note. Some of his beautiful countrywomen,
however, possess precious memorials in the shape of letters
written in Polish, which he loved much more than French.
His thoughtfulness was continually sending pleasant little
gifts and souvenirs to his Warsaw friends. This tenderness
and consideration displayed itself too in his love of children.
He would spend whole evenings in playing blind-man&rsquo;s-buff
or telling them charming fairy stories from the folk-lore in
which Poland is singularly rich.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
Always gentle, he yet knew how to rebuke arrogance, and
had sharp repartees for those who tried to force him into
musical display. On one occasion, when he had just left
the dining-room, an indiscreet host, who had had the
simplicity to promise his guests some piece executed by him
as a rare dessert, pointed him to an open piano. Chopin
quietly refused, but on being pressed said, with a languid
and sneering drawl:&mdash;&ldquo;Ah, sir, I have just dined; your
hospitality, I see, demands payment.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Mdme. Sand, in her <i>Lettres d&rsquo;un Voyageur</i>, depicts the
painful lethargy which seizes the artist when, having incorporated
the emotion which inspired him in his work, his
imagination still remains under the dominance of the
insatiate idea, without being able to find a new incarnation.
She was suffering in this way when the character of Chopin
excited her curiosity and suggested a healthful and happy
relief. Chopin dreaded to meet this modern Sibyl. The
superstitious awe he felt was a premonition whose meaning
was hidden from him. They met, and Chopin lost his fear
in one of those passions which feed on the whole being with
a ceaseless hunger.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1837 Chopin yielded to a severe attack of
the disease which was hereditary in his frame. In company
with Mdme. Sand, who had become his constant companion,
he went to the isle of Majorca, to find rest and medicine in
the balmy breezes of the Mediterranean. All the happiness
of Chopin&rsquo;s life was gathered in the focus of this experience.
He had a most loving and devoted nurse, who yielded to
all his whims, soothed his fretfulness, and watched over him
as a mother does over a child. The grounds of the villa
where they lived were as perfect as Nature and art could
make them, and exquisite scenes greeted the eye at every
turn. Here they spent long golden days.</p>

<p>The feelings of Chopin for his gifted companion are best
painted by herself in the pages of <i>Lucrezia Floriani</i>, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
she is the &ldquo;Floriani,&rdquo; Liszt &ldquo;Count Salvator Albani,&rdquo; and
Chopin &ldquo;Prince Karol&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It seemed as if this fragile being
was absorbed and consumed by the strength of his affection....
But he loved for the sake of loving.... His love
was his life, and, delicious or bitter, he had not the power
of withdrawing himself a single moment from its domination.&rdquo;
Slowly she nursed him back into temporary health, and in
the sunlight of her love his mind assumed a gaiety and
cheerfulness it had never known before.</p>

<p>It had been the passionate hope of Chopin to marry Mdme.
Sand, but wedlock was alien alike to her philosophy and
preference. After a protracted intimacy, she wearied of his
persistent entreaties, or perhaps her self-development had
exhausted what it sought in the poet-musician. An absolute
separation came, and his mistress buried the episode in her
life with the epitaph&mdash;&ldquo;Two natures, one rich in its exuberance,
the other in its exclusiveness, could never really mingle,
and a whole world separated them.&rdquo; Chopin said&mdash;&ldquo;All
the cords that bind me to life are broken.&rdquo; His sad summary
of all was that his life had been an episode which began and
ended in Paris. What a contrast to the being of a few years
before, of whom it is written&mdash;&ldquo;He was no longer on the
earth; he was in an empyrean of golden clouds and perfumes;
his imagination, so full of exquisite beauty, seemed
engaged in a monologue with God himself!&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>Both Liszt and Mdme. Dudevant have painted Chopin
somewhat as a sickly sentimentalist, living in an atmosphere
of moonshine and unreality. Yet this was not precisely true.
In spite of his delicacy of frame and romantic imagination,
Chopin was never ill till within the last ten years of his life,
when the seeds of hereditary consumption developed themselves.
As a young man he was lively and joyous, always
ready for frolic, and with a great fund of humour, especially
in caricature. Students of human character know how consistent
these traits are with a deep undercurrent of melancholy,
which colours the whole life when the immediate impulse of
joy subsides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
From the date of 1840 Chopin&rsquo;s health declined; but
through the seven years during which his connection with
Mdme. Sand continued, he persevered actively in his work of
composition. The final rupture with the woman he so madly
loved seems to have been his death-blow. He spoke of
Mdme. Sand without bitterness, but his soul pined in the
bitter-sweet of memory. He recovered partially, and spent
a short season of concert-giving in London, where he was
f&ecirc;ted and caressed by the best society as he had been in
Paris. Again he was sharply assailed by his fatal malady,
and he returned to Paris to die. Let us describe one of his
last earthly experiences, on Sunday, the 15th of October
1849.</p>

<p>Chopin had lain insensible from one of his swooning
attacks for some time. His sister Louise was by his side,
and the Countess Delphine Potocka, his beautiful countrywoman
and a most devoted friend, watched him with streaming
eyes. The dying musician became conscious, and faintly
ordered a piano to be rolled in from the adjoining room.
He turned to the countess, and whispered, feebly, &ldquo;Sing.&rdquo;
She had a lovely voice, and, gathering herself for the effort,
she sang that famous canticle to the Virgin which, tradition
says, saved Stradella&rsquo;s life from assassins. &ldquo;How beautiful
it is!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;My God! how very beautiful!&rdquo;
Again she sang to him, and the dying musician passed into
a trance, from which he never fully aroused till he expired,
two days afterwards, in the arms of his pupil, M. Gutman.</p>

<p>Chopin&rsquo;s obsequies took place at the Madeleine Church,
and Lablache sang on this occasion the same passage, the
&ldquo;Tuba Mirum&rdquo; of Mozart&rsquo;s Requiem Mass, which he had
sung at the funeral of Beethoven in 1827; while the other
solos were given by Mdme. Viardot Garcia and Mdme.
Castellan. He lies in P&egrave;re Lachaise, beside Cherubini and
Bellini.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>The compositions of Chopin were exclusively for the
piano; and alike as composer and virtuoso he is the founder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
of a new school, or perhaps may be said to share that
honour with Robert Schumann&mdash;the school which to-day is
represented in its advanced form by Liszt and Von B&uuml;low.
Schumann called him &ldquo;the boldest and proudest poetic
spirit of the times.&rdquo; In addition to this remarkable poetic
power, he was a splendidly-trained musician, a great adept
in style, and one of the most original masters of rhythm and
harmony that the records of music show. All his works,
though wanting in breadth and robustness of tone, are
characterised by the utmost finish and refinement. Full of
delicate and unexpected beauties, elaborated with the finest
touch, his effects are so quaint and fresh as to fill the mind
of the listener with pleasurable sensations, perhaps not to be
derived from grander works.</p>

<p>Chopin was essentially the musical exponent of his nation;
for he breathed in all the forms of his art the sensibilities,
the fires, the aspirations, and the melancholy of the Polish
race. This is not only evident in his polonaises, his waltzes
and mazurkas, in which the wild Oriental rhythms of the
original dances are treated with the creative skill of genius;
but also in the <i>&eacute;tudes</i>, the preludes, nocturnes, scherzos,
ballads, etc., with which he so enriched musical literature.
His genius could never confine itself within classic bonds,
but, fantastic and impulsive, swayed and bent itself with easy
grace to inspirations that were always novel and startling,
though his boldness was chastened by deep study and fine
art-sense.</p>

<p>All of the suggestions of the quaint and beautiful Polish
dance-music were worked by Chopin into a variety of forms,
and were greatly enriched by his skill in handling. He
dreamed out his early reminiscences in music, and these
national memories became embalmed in the history of art.
The polonaises are marked by the fire and ardour of his
soldier race, and the mazurkas are full of the coquetry and
tenderness of his countrywomen; while the ballads are a
free and powerful rendering of Polish folk-music, beloved
alike in the herdsman&rsquo;s hut and the palace of the noble.
In deriving his inspiration direct from the national heart,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
Chopin did what Schumann, Schubert, and Weber did in
Germany, what Rossini did in Italy, and shares with them
a freshness of melodic power to be derived from no other
source. Rather tender and elegiac than vigorous, the deep
sadness underlying the most sparkling forms of his work is
most notable. One can at times almost recognise the
requiem of a nation in the passionate melancholy on whose
dark background his fancy weaves such beautiful figures and
colours.</p>

<p>Franz Liszt, in characterising Chopin as a composer, furnishes
an admirable study&mdash;&ldquo;We meet with beauties of a
high order, expressions entirely new, and a harmonic tissue
as original as erudite. In his compositions boldness is
always justified; richness, often exuberance, never interferes
with clearness; singularity never degenerates into the
uncouth and fantastic; the sculpturing is never disordered;
the luxury of ornament never overloads the chaste eloquence
of the principal lines. His best works abound in combinations
which may be said to be an epoch in the handling of
musical style. Daring, brilliant, and attractive, they disguise
their profundity under so much grace, their science
under so many charms, that it is with difficulty we free ourselves
sufficiently from their magical enthralment, to judge
coldly of their theoretical value.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a romance composer Chopin struck out his own path,
and has no rival. Full of originality, his works display the
utmost dignity and refinement. He revolted from the
bizarre and eccentric, though the peculiar influences which
governed his development might well have betrayed one less
finely organised.</p>

<p>As a musical poet, embodying the feelings and tendencies
of a people, Chopin advances his chief claim to his place in
art. He did not task himself to be a national musician;
for he is utterly without pretence and affectation, and sings
spontaneously, without design or choice, from the fullness
of a rich nature. He collected &ldquo;in luminous sheaves the
impressions felt everywhere through his country&mdash;vaguely
felt, it is true, yet in fragments pervading all hearts.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
Chopin was repelled by the lusty and almost coarse
humour sometimes displayed by Schubert, for he was painfully
fastidious. He could not fully understand nor appreciate
Beethoven, whose works are full of lion-marrow,
robust and masculine alike in conception and treatment.
He did not admire Shakespeare, because his great delineations
are too vivid and realistic. Our musician was essentially
a dreamer and idealist. His range was limited, but
within it he reached perfection of finish and originality never
surpassed. But, with all his limitations, the art-judgment of
the world places him high among those</p>

<h2><a name="weber" id="weber"></a><i>WEBER.</i></h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> genius which inspired the three great works, &ldquo;Der
Freisch&uuml;tz,&rdquo; &ldquo;Euryanthe,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oberon,&rdquo; has stamped
itself as one of the most original and characteristic in
German music. Full of bold and surprising strokes of
imagination, these operas are marked by the true atmosphere
of national life and feeling, and we feel in them the
fresh, rich colour of the popular traditions and song-music
which make the German <i>Lieder</i> such an inexhaustible
treasure-trove. As Weber was maturing into that fullness of
power which gave to the world his greater works, Germany
had been wrought into a passionate patriotism by the Napoleonic
wars. The call to arms resounded from one end of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
the Fatherland to the other. Every hamlet thrilled with fervour,
and all the resources of national tradition were evoked
to heighten the love of country into a puissance which
should save the land. Germany had been humiliated by a
series of crushing defeats, and national pride was stung to
vindicate the grand old memories. France, in answer to a
similar demand for some art-expression of its patriotism, had
produced its Rouget de Lisle; Germany produced the poet
K&ouml;rner and the musician Weber.</p>

<p>It is not easy to appreciate the true quality and significance
of Weber&rsquo;s art-life without considering the peculiar
state of Germany at the time; for if ever creative imagination
was forged and fashioned by its environments into a
logical expression of public needs and impulses, it was in
the case of the father of German romantic opera. This
inspiration permeated the whole soil of national thought,
and its embodiment in art and letters has hardly any parallel
except in that brilliant morning of English thought which
we know as the Elizabethan era. To understand Weber
the composer, then, we must think of him not only as the
musician, but as the patriot and revivalist of ancient tendencies
in art, drawn directly from the warm heart of the
people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Karl Maria von Weber</span> was born at Eutin, in Holstein,
December 18, 1786. His father had been a soldier, but,
owing to extravagance and folly, had left the career of arms,
and, being an educated musician, had become by turns
attached to an orchestra, director of a theatre, Kapellmeister,
and wandering player&mdash;never remaining long in one position,
for he was essentially vagrant and desultory in character.
Whatever Karl Maria had to suffer from his father&rsquo;s folly
and eccentricity, he was indebted to him for an excellent
training in the art of which he was to become so brilliant
an ornament. He had excellent masters in singing and the
piano, as also in drawing and engraving. So he grew
up a melancholy, imaginative recluse, absorbed in his
studies, and living in a dream-land of his own, which he
peopled with ideal creations. His passionate love of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
Nature, tinged with old German superstition, planted in his
imagination those fruitful germs which bore such rich
results in after years.</p>

<p>In 1797 Weber studied the piano and composition under
Hanschkel, a thoroughly scientific musician, and found in
his severe drill a happy counter-balancing influence to the
more desultory studies which had preceded. Major Weber&rsquo;s
restless tendencies did not permit his family to remain
long in one place. In 1798 they moved to Salzburg,
where young Weber was placed at the musical institute
of which Michael Haydn, brother of the great Joseph, was
director. Here a variety of misfortunes assailed the Weber
family. Major Franz Anton was unsuccessful in all his
theatrical undertakings, and extreme poverty stared them
all in the face. The gentle mother, too, whom Karl so
dearly loved, sickened and died. This was a terrible
blow to the affectionate boy, from which he did not soon
recover.</p>

<p>The next resting-place in the pilgrimage of the Weber
family was Munich, where Major Weber, who, however
flagrant his shortcomings in other ways, was resolved that
the musical powers of his son should be thoroughly
trained, placed him under the care of the organist Kalcher
for studies in composition.</p>

<p>For several years, Karl was obliged to lead the same
shifting, nomadic sort of life, never stopping long, but
dragged hither and thither in obedience to his father&rsquo;s
vagaries and necessities, but always studying under the best
masters who could be obtained. While under Kalcher,
several masses, sonatas, trios, and an opera, &ldquo;Die Macht
der Liebe und des Weins&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Might of Love and
Wine&rdquo;), were written. Another opera, &ldquo;Das Waldm&auml;dchen&rdquo;
(&ldquo;The Forest Maiden&rdquo;), was composed and produced
when he was fourteen; and two years later in Salzburg he
composed &ldquo;Peter Schmoll und seine Nachbarn,&rdquo; an
operetta, which exacted warm praise from Michael Haydn.</p>

<p>At the age of seventeen he became the pupil of the great
teacher, Abb&eacute; Vogler, under whose charge also Meyerbeer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
was then studying. Our young composer worked with
great assiduity under the able instruction of Vogler, who
was of vast service in bringing the chaos of his previous
contradictory teachings into order and light. All these
musical <i>Wanderjahre</i>, however trying, had steeled Karl
Maria into a stern self-reliance, and he found in his skill as
an engraver the means to remedy his father&rsquo;s wastefulness
and folly.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>A curious episode in Weber&rsquo;s life was his connection
with the royal family of W&uuml;rtemberg, where he found a
dissolute, poverty-stricken court, and a whimsical, arrogant,
half-crazy king. Here he remained four years in a half-official
musical position, his nominal duty being that of
secretary to the king&rsquo;s brother, Prince Ludwig. This part
of his career was almost a sheer waste, full of dreary and
irritating experiences, which Weber afterwards spoke of with
disgust and regret. His spirit revolted from the capricious
tyranny which he was obliged to undergo, but circumstances
seem to have coerced him into a protracted endurance of
the place. His letters tell us how bitterly he detested the
king and his dull, pompous court, though Prince Ludwig in
a way seemed to have been attached to his secretary. One
of his biographers says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Weber hated the king, of whose wild caprice and vices
he witnessed daily scenes, before whose palace-gates he was
obliged to slink bareheaded, and who treated him with
unmerited ignominy. Sceptre and crown had never been
imposing objects in his eyes, unless worn by a worthy man;
and consequently he was wont, in the thoughtless levity of
youth, to forget the dangers he ran, and to answer the king
with a freedom of tone which the autocrat was all unused to
hear. In turn he was detested by the monarch. As
negotiator for the spendthrift Prince Ludwig, he was already
obnoxious enough; and it sometimes happened that, by
way of variety to the customary torrent of invective, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
king, after keeping the secretary for hours in his antechamber,
would receive him only to turn him rudely out of
the room, without hearing a word he had to say.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>At last Karl Maria&rsquo;s indignation burst over bounds at
some unusual indignity; and he played a practical joke on
the king. Meeting an old woman in the palace one day
near the door of the royal sanctum, she asked him where
she could find the court-washerwoman. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said the
reckless Weber, pointing to the door of the king&rsquo;s cabinet.
The king, who hated old women, was in a transport of rage,
and, on her terror-stricken explanation of the intrusion, had
no difficulty in fixing the mischief in the right quarter.
Weber was thrown into prison, and had it not been for
Prince Ludwig&rsquo;s intercession he would have remained there
for several years. While confined he managed to compose
one of his most beautiful songs, &ldquo;Ein steter Kampf ist unser
Leben.&rdquo; He had not long been released when he was again
imprisoned on account of some of his father&rsquo;s wretched
follies, that arrogant old gentleman being utterly reckless
how he involved others, so long as he carried out his own
selfish purposes and indulgence. His friend Danzi, director
of the royal opera at Stuttgart, proved his good genius in
this instance; for he wrangled with the king till his young
friend was released.</p>

<p>Weber&rsquo;s only consolations during this dismal life in Stuttgart
were the friendship of Danzi, and his love for a beautiful
singer named Gretchen. Danzi was a true mentor and
a devoted friend. He was wont to say to Karl&mdash;&ldquo;To be a
true artist, you must be a true man.&rdquo; But the lovely Gretchen,
however she may have consoled his somewhat arid
life, was not a beneficial influence, for she led him into many
sad extravagances and an unwholesome taste for playing the
cavalier.</p>

<p>In spite of his discouraging surroundings, Weber&rsquo;s creative
power was active during this period, and showed how,
perhaps unconsciously to himself, he was growing in power
and depth of experience. He wrote the cantata, &ldquo;Der erste
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
Ton,&rdquo; a large number of songs, the first of his great piano
sonatas, several overtures and symphonies, and the opera
&ldquo;Sylvana&rdquo; (&ldquo;Das Waldm&auml;dchen&rdquo; rewritten and enlarged),
which, both in its music and libretto, seems to have been
the precursor of his great works, &ldquo;Der Freisch&uuml;tz&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Euryanthe.&rdquo; At the first performance of &ldquo;Sylvana&rdquo; in
Frankfort, September 16, 1810, he met Miss Caroline
Brandt, who sang the principal character. She afterwards
became his wife, and her love and devotion were the solace
of his life.</p>

<p>Weber spent most of the year 1810 in Darmstadt, where
he again met Vogler and Meyerbeer. Vogler&rsquo;s severe
artistic instructions were of great value to Weber in curbing
his extravagance, and impressing on him that restraint was
one of the most valuable factors in art. What Vogler
thought of Weber we learn from a letter in which he writes&mdash;&ldquo;Had
I been forced to leave the world before I found these
two, Weber and Meyerbeer, I should have died a miserable
man.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>It was about this time, while visiting Mannheim, that the
idea of &ldquo;Der Freisch&uuml;tz&rdquo; first entered his mind. His
friend the poet Kind was with him, and they were ransacking
an old book, Apel&rsquo;s <i>Ghost Stories</i>. One of these dealt
with the ancient legend of the hunter Bartusch, a woodland
myth ranking high in German folk-lore. They were both
delighted with the fantastic and striking story, full of the
warm colouring of Nature, and the balmy atmosphere of
the forest and mountain. They immediately arranged the
framework of the libretto, afterwards written by Kind, and
set to such weird and enchanting music by Weber.</p>

<p>In 1811 Weber began to give concerts, for his reputation
was becoming known far and wide as a brilliant composer
and virtuoso. For two years he played a round of concerts
in Munich, Leipsic, Gotha, Weimar, Berlin, and other places.
He was everywhere warmly welcomed. Lichtenstein,
in his <i>Memoir of Weber</i>, writes of his Berlin reception&mdash;&ldquo;Young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
artists fell on their knees before him; others
embraced him wherever they could get at him. All
crowded around him, till his head was crowned, not with a
chaplet of flowers, but a circlet of happy faces.&rdquo; The
devotion of his friends, his happy family relations, the
success of his published works, conspired to make Weber
cheerful and joyous beyond his wont, for he was naturally
of a melancholy and serious turn, disposed to look at life
from its tragic side.</p>

<p>In 1813 he was called to Prague to direct the music of
the German opera in that Bohemian capital. The Bohemians
had always been a highly musical race, and their chief city
is associated in the minds of the students of music as the
place where many of the great operas were first presented to
the public. Mozart loved Prague, for he found in its people
the audiences who appreciated and honoured him the most.
Its traditions were honoured in their treatment of Weber,
for his three years there were among the happiest of his life.</p>

<p>Our composer wrote his opera of &ldquo;Der Freisch&uuml;tz&rdquo; in
Dresden. It was first produced in the opera-house of that
classic city, but it was not till 1821, when it was performed
in Berlin, that its greatness was recognised. Weber can
best tell the story of its reception himself. In his letter to
his co-author, Kind, he writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;The free-shooter has hit the mark. The second representation
has succeeded as well as the first; there was the
same enthusiasm. All the places in the house are taken
for the third, which comes off to-morrow. It is the
greatest triumph one can have. You cannot imagine what
a lively interest your text inspires from beginning to end.
How happy I should have been if you had only been
present to hear it for yourself! Some of the scenes
produced an effect which I was far from anticipating; for
example, that of the young girls. If I see you again at
Dresden, I will tell you all about it; for I cannot do it
justice in writing. How much I am indebted to you for
your magnificent poem! I embrace you with the sincerest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
emotion, returning to your muse the laurels I owe her.
God grant that you may be happy. Love him who loves
you with infinite respect.</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Your Weber.</span>&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Der Freisch&uuml;tz&rdquo; was such a success as to place the
composer in the front ranks of the lyric stage. The
striking originality, the fire, the passion of his music, the
ardent national feeling, and the freshness of treatment,
gave a genuine shock of delight and surprise to the German
world.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The opera of &ldquo;Preciosa,&rdquo; also a masterpiece, was given
shortly after with great <i>&eacute;clat</i>, though it failed to inspire the
deep enthusiasm which greeted &ldquo;Der Freisch&uuml;tz.&rdquo; In
1823, &ldquo;Euryanthe&rdquo; was produced in Berlin&mdash;a work on
which Weber exhausted all the treasures of his musical
genius. Without the elements of popular success which
made his first great opera such an immediate favourite, it
shows the most finished and scholarly work which Weber
ever attained. Its symmetry and completeness, the elaboration
of all the forms, the richness and variety of the
orchestration, bear witness to the long and thoughtful
labour expended on it. It gradually won its way to
popular recognition, and has always remained one of the
favourite works of the German stage.</p>

<p>The opera of &ldquo;Oberon&rdquo; was Weber&rsquo;s last great production.
The celebrated poet Wieland composed the poem
underlying the libretto, from the medi&aelig;val romance of
Huon of Bordeaux. The scenes are laid in fairy-land, and
it may be almost called a German &ldquo;Midsummer-Night&rsquo;s
Dream,&rdquo; though the story differs widely from the charming
phantasy of our own Shakespeare. The opera of &ldquo;Oberon&rdquo;
was written for Kemble, of the Covent Garden theatre, in
London, and was produced by Weber under circumstances
of failing health and great mental depression. The composer
pressed every energy to the utmost to meet his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
engagement, and it was feared by his friends that he would
not live to see it put on the stage. It did, indeed, prove
the song of the dying swan, for he only lived four months
after reaching London. &ldquo;Oberon&rdquo; was performed with
immense success under the direction of Sir George Smart,
and the fading days of the author were cheered by the
acclamations of the English public; but the work cost him
his life. He died in London, June 5, 1826. His last
words were&mdash;&ldquo;God reward you for all your kindness to me.&mdash;Now
let me sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apart from his dramatic compositions, Weber is known
for his many beautiful overtures and symphonies for the
orchestra, and his various works for the piano, from
sonatas to waltzes and minuets. Among his most pleasing
piano-works are the &ldquo;Invitation to the Waltz,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Perpetual Rondo,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Polonaise in E&nbsp;major.&rdquo;
Many of his songs rank among the finest German lyrics.
He would have been recognised as an able composer had he
not produced great operas; but the superior excellence of
these cast all his other compositions in the shade.</p>

<p>Weber was fortunate in having gifted poets to write his
dramas. As rich as he was in melodic affluence, his
creative faculty seems to have had its tap-root in deep
personal feelings and enthusiasms. One of the most poetic
and picturesque of composers, he needed a powerful
exterior suggestion to give his genius wings and fire. The
Germany of his time was alive with patriotic ardour, and
the existence of the nation gathered from its emergencies
new strength and force. The heart of Weber beat strong
with the popular life. Romantic and serious in his taste,
his imagination fed on old German tradition and song, and
drew from them its richest food. The whole life of the
Fatherland, with its glow of love for home, its keen
sympathies with the influences of Nature, its fantastic play
of thought, its tendency to embody the primitive forces in
weird myths, found in Weber an eloquent exponent; and
we perceive in his music all the colour and vividness of
these influences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
Weber&rsquo;s love of Nature was singularly keen. The
woods, the mountains, the lakes, and the streams, spoke to
his soul with voices full of meaning. He excelled in
making these voices speak and sing; and he may, therefore,
be entitled the father of the romantic and descriptive
school in German operatic music. With more breadth and
robustness, he expressed the national feelings of his people,
even as Chopin did those of dying Poland. Weber&rsquo;s
motives are generally caught from the immemorial airs
which resound in every village and hamlet, and the fresh
beat of the German heart sends its thrill through almost
every bar of his music. Here is found the ultimate
significance of his art-work, apart from the mere musical
beauty of his compositions.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2><a name="mendelssohn" id="mendelssohn"></a><i>MENDELSSOHN.</i></h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Few</span> careers could present more startling contrasts than
those of Mozart and Mendelssohn, in many respects of
similar genius, but utterly opposed in the whole surroundings
of their lives. <span class="smcap">Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy</span>
was the grandson of the celebrated philosopher, Moses
Mendelssohn, and the son of a rich Hamburg banker.
His uncles were distinguished in literary and social life.
His friends from early childhood were eminent scholars,
poets, painters, and musicians, and his family moved in
the most refined and wealthy circles. He was nursed in
the lap of luxury, and never knew the cold and hunger of
life. All the good fairies and graces seemed to have
smiled benignly on his birth, and to have showered on him
their richest gifts. Many successful wooers of the muse
have been, fortunately for themselves, the heirs of poverty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
and became successful only to yield themselves to fat and
slothful ease. But, with every incitement to an idle and
contented life, Mendelssohn toiled like a galley-slave, and
saw in his wealth only the means of a more exclusive
consecration to his art. A passionate impulse to labour
was the law of his life.</p>

<p>Many will recollect the brilliant novel, <i>Charles
Auchester</i>, in which, under the names of Seraphael,
Aronach, Charles Auchester, Julia Bennett, and Starwood
Burney, are painted the characters of Mendelssohn, Zelter
his teacher, Joachim the violinist, Jenny Lind, and
Sterndale Bennett, the English composer. The brilliant
colouring does not disguise nor flatter the lofty Christian
purity, the splendid genius, and the great personal charm
of the composer, who shares in largest measure the homage
which the English public lays at the feet of Handel.</p>

<p>As child and youth Mendelssohn, born at Hamburg,
February 3, 1809, displayed the same precocity of talent as
was shown by Mozart. Sir Julius Benedict relates his
first meeting with him. He was walking in Berlin with
Von Weber, and the latter called his attention to a boy
about eleven years old, who, perceiving the author of &ldquo;Der
Freisch&uuml;tz,&rdquo; gave him a hearty greeting. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis Felix
Mendelssohn,&rdquo; said Weber, introducing the marvellous boy.
Benedict narrates his amazement to find the extraordinary
attainments of this beautiful youth, with curling auburn
hair, brilliant clear eyes, and lips smiling with innocence
and candour. Five minutes after young Mendelssohn had
astonished his English friend by his admirable performance
of several of his own compositions, he forgot Weber,
quartets, and counterpoint, to leap over the garden hedges
and climb the trees like a squirrel. When scarcely twenty
years old he had composed his octet, three quartets for
the piano and strings, two sonatas, two symphonies, his
first violin quartet, various operas, many songs, and the
immortal overture of &ldquo;A Midsummer-Night&rsquo;s Dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mendelssohn received an admirable education, was an
excellent classicist and linguist, and during a short residence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
at D&uuml;sseldorf showed such talent for painting as to excite
much wonder. Before he was twenty he was the friend of
Goethe and Herder, who delighted in a genius so rich and
symmetrical. Some of Goethe&rsquo;s letters are full of charming
expressions of praise and affection, for the aged Jupiter of
German literature found in the promise of this young
Apollo something of the many-sided power which made
himself so remarkable.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The Mendelssohn family had moved to Berlin when Felix
was only three years old, and the Berliners always
claimed him as their own. Strange to say, the city of his
birth did not recognise his talent for many years. At the
age of twenty he went to England, and the high breeding,
personal beauty, and charming manner of the young
musician gave him the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> into the most fastidious and
exclusive circles. His first symphony and the &ldquo;Midsummer-Night&rsquo;s
Dream&rdquo; overture stamped his power with
the verdict of a warm enthusiasm; for London, though
cold and conservative, is prompt to recognise a superior
order of merit.</p>

<p>His travels through Scotland inspired Mendelssohn with
sentiments of great admiration. The scenery filled his
mind with the highest suggestions of beauty and grandeur.
He afterwards tells us that &ldquo;he preferred the cold sky and
the pines of the north to charming scenes in the midst of
landscapes bathed in the glowing rays of the sun and azure
light.&rdquo; The vague Ossianic figures that raised their
gigantic heads in the fog-wreaths of clouded mountain-tops
and lonely lochs had a peculiar fascination for him, and
acted like wine on his imagination. The &ldquo;Hebrides&rdquo;
overture was the fruit of this tour, one of the most
powerful and characteristic of his minor compositions. His
sister Fanny (Mrs. Hensel) asked him to describe the grey
scenery of the north, and he replied in music by improvising
his impressions. This theme was afterwards worked out
in the elaborate overture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
We will not follow him in his various travels through
France and Italy. Suffice it to say, that his keen and
passionate mind absorbed everything in art which could
feed the divine hunger, for he was ever discontented, and
had his mind fixed on an absolute and determined ideal.
During this time of travel he became intimate with the
sculptor Thorwaldsen, and the painters Leopold Robert
and Horace Vernet. This period produced &ldquo;Walpurgis
Night,&rdquo; the first of the &ldquo;Songs without Words,&rdquo; the great
symphony in A major, and the &ldquo;Melusine&rdquo; overture. He
is now about to enter on the epoch which puts to the
fullest test the varied resources of his genius. To
Moscheles he writes, in answer to his old teacher&rsquo;s warm
praise&mdash;&ldquo;Your praise is better than three orders of
nobility.&rdquo; For several years we see him busy in multifarious
ways, composing, leading musical festivals, concert-giving,
directing opera-houses, and yet finding time to keep
up a busy correspondence with the most distinguished men
in Europe; for Mendelssohn seemed to find in letter-writing
a rest for his over-taxed brain.</p>

<p>In 1835 he completed his great oratorio of &ldquo;St. Paul,&rdquo; for
Leipsic. The next year he received the title of Doctor of
Philosophy and the Fine Arts; and in 1837 he married the
charming C&eacute;cile Jeanrenaud, who made his domestic life so
gentle and harmonious. It has been thought strange that
Mendelssohn should have made so little mention of his
lovely wife in his letters, so prone as he was to speak of
affairs of his daily life. Be this as it may, his correspondence
with Moscheles, Devrient, and others, as well as the general
testimony of his friends, shows us unmistakably that his
home-life was blessed in an exceptional degree with
intellectual sympathy, and the tenderest and most
thoughtful love.</p>

<p>In 1841 Mendelssohn became Kapellmeister of the
Prussian court. He now wrote the &ldquo;Athalie&rdquo; music, the
&ldquo;Midsummer-Night&rsquo;s Dream,&rdquo; and a large number of lesser
pieces, including the &ldquo;Songs without Words,&rdquo; and piano
sonatas, as well as much church music. The greatest work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
of this period was the &ldquo;Hymn of Praise,&rdquo; a symphonic
cantata for the Leipsic anniversary of the invention of
printing, regarded by many as his finest composition.</p>

<p>Mendelssohn always loved England, and made frequent
visits across the Channel; for he felt that among
the English he was fully appreciated, both as man and
composer.</p>

<p>His oratorio of &ldquo;Elijah&rdquo; was composed for the English
public, and produced at the great Birmingham festival in
1846, under his own direction, with magnificent success.
It was given a second time in April 1847, with his final
refinements and revisions; and the event was regarded in
England as one of the greatest since the days of Handel, to
whom, as well as to Haydn and Beethoven, Mendelssohn
showed himself a worthy rival in the field of oratorio
composition. Of this visit to England Lampadius, his
friend and biographer, writes&mdash;&ldquo;Her Majesty, who as well
as her husband was a great friend of art, and herself a
distinguished musician, received the distinguished German
in her own sitting-room, Prince Albert being the only one
present besides herself. As he entered she asked his pardon
for the somewhat disorderly state of the room, and began to
rearrange the articles with her own hands, Mendelssohn
himself gallantly offering his assistance. Some parrots
whose cages hung in the room she herself carried into the
next room, in which Mendelssohn helped her also. She
then requested her guest to play something, and afterwards
sang some songs of his which she had sung at a court
concert soon after the attack on her person. She was not
wholly pleased, however, with her own performance, and
said pleasantly to Mendelssohn, &lsquo;I can do better&mdash;ask
Lablache if I cannot; but I am afraid of you!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>This anecdote was related by Mendelssohn himself to
show the graciousness of the English queen. It was
at this time that Prince Albert sent to Mendelssohn
the book of the oratorio &ldquo;Elijah&rdquo; with which he used
to follow the performance, with the following autographic
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
&ldquo;To the noble artist, who, surrounded by the Baal
worship of corrupted art, has been able by his genius
and science to preserve faithfully like another Elijah the
worship of true art, and once more to accustom our ear,
lost in the whirl of an empty play of sounds, to the pure
notes of expressive composition and legitimate harmony&mdash;to
the great master, who makes us conscious of the unity of
his conception through the whole maze of his creation, from
the soft whispering to the mighty raging of the elements:
Written in token of grateful remembrance by</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Albert</span>.</p>

<p class="address">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>April 24, 1847</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>An occurrence at the Birmingham festival throws a clear
light on Mendelssohn&rsquo;s presence of mind, and on his faculty
of instant concentration. On the last day, among other
things, one of Handel&rsquo;s anthems was given. The concert
was already going on, when it was discovered that the short
recitative which precedes the &ldquo;Coronation Hymn,&rdquo; and
which the public had in the printed text, was lacking in the
voice parts. The directors were perplexed. Mendelssohn,
who was sitting in an ante-room of the hall, heard of it, and
said, &ldquo;Wait, I will help you.&rdquo; He sat down directly at a
table, and composed the music for the recitative and the
orchestral accompaniment in about half an hour. It was at
once transcribed, and given without any rehearsal, and went
very finely.</p>

<p>On returning to Leipsic he determined to pass the
summer in Vevay, Switzerland, on account of his failing
health, which had begun to alarm himself and his friends.
His letters from Switzerland at this period show how the
shadow of rapidly approaching death already threw a deep
gloom over his habitually cheerful nature. He returned to
Leipsic, and resumed hard work. His operetta entitled
&ldquo;Return from among Strangers&rdquo; was his last production,
with the exception of some lively songs and a few piano
pieces of the &ldquo;Lieder ohne Worte,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Songs without
Words,&rdquo; series. Mendelssohn was seized with an apoplectic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
attack on October 9, 1847. Second and third seizures
quickly followed, and he died November 4th, aged thirty-eight
years.</p>

<p>All Germany and Europe sorrowed over the loss of this
great musician, and his funeral was attended by many of
the most distinguished persons from all parts of the
land, for the loss was felt to be something like a national
calamity.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Mendelssohn was one of the most intelligent and scholarly
composers of the century. Learned in various branches of
knowledge, and personally a man of unusual accomplishments,
his career was full of manly energy, enlightened
enthusiasm, and severe devotion to the highest forms of
the art of music. Not only his great oratorios, &ldquo;St. Paul&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Elijah,&rdquo; but his music for the piano, including the
&ldquo;Songs without Words,&rdquo; sonatas, and many occasional
pieces, have won him a high place among his musical
brethren. As an orchestral composer, his overtures are
filled with strikingly original thoughts and elevated conceptions,
expressed with much delicacy of instrumental
colouring. He was brought but little in contact with the
French and Italian schools, and there is found in his works
a severity of art-form which shows how closely he sympathised
with Bach and Handel in his musical tendencies.
He died while at the very zenith of his powers, and we may
well believe that a longer life would have developed much
richer beauty in his compositions. Short as his career was,
however, he left a great number of magnificent works,
which entitle him to a place among the Titans of music.</p>

<h2><a name="wagner" id="wagner"></a><i>RICHARD WAGNER.</i></h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is curious to note how often art-controversy has become
edged with a bitterness rivalling even the gall and venom
of religious dispute. Scholars have not yet forgotten the
fiery war of words which raged between Richard Bentley
and his opponents concerning the authenticity of the
<i>Epistles of Phalaris</i>, nor how literary Germany was divided
into two hostile camps by Wolf&rsquo;s attack on the personality
of Homer. It is no less fresh in the minds of critics how
that modern Jupiter, Lessing, waged a long and bitter
battle with the Titans of the French classical drama, and
finally crushed them with the thunderbolt of the <i>Dramaturgie</i>;
nor what acrimony sharpened the discussion
between the rival theorists in music, Gluck and Piccini,
at Paris. All of the intensity of these art-campaigns, and
many of the conditions of the last, enter into the contest
between Richard Wagner and the <i>Italianissimi</i> of the
present day.</p>

<p>The exact points at issue were for a long time so befogged
by the smoke of the battle that many of the large class
who are musically interested, but never had an opportunity
to study the question, will find an advantage in a clear and
comprehensive sketch of the facts and principles involved.
Until recently there were still many people who thought of
Wagner as a youthful and eccentric enthusiast, all afire
with misdirected genius, a mere carpet-knight on the
sublime battle-field of art, a beginner just sowing his wild-oats
in works like &ldquo;Lohengrin,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tristan and Iseult,&rdquo; or
the &ldquo;Rheingold.&rdquo; It is a revelation full of suggestive value
for these to realise that he is a musical thinker, ripe with
sixty years of labour and experience; that he represents
the rarest and choicest fruits of modern culture, not only
as musician, but as poet and philosopher; that he is one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
the few examples in the history of the art where massive
scholarship and the power of subtile analysis have been
united, in a pre-eminent degree, with great creative genius.
Preliminary to a study of what Wagner and his disciples
entitled the &ldquo;Art-work of the Future,&rdquo; let us take a swift
survey of music as a medium of expression for the beautiful,
and some of the forms which it has assumed.</p>

<p>This Ariel of the fine arts sends its messages to the
human soul by virtue of a fourfold capacity&mdash;Firstly, the
imitation of the voices of Nature, such as the winds, the
waves, and the cries of animals; secondly, its potential
delight as melody, modulation, rhythm, harmony&mdash;in other
words, its simple worth as a &ldquo;thing of beauty,&rdquo; without
regard to cause or consequence; thirdly, its force of boundless
suggestion; fourthly, that affinity for union with the
more definite and exact forms of the imagination (poetry),
by which the intellectual context of the latter is raised to a
far higher power of grace, beauty, passion, sweetness, without
losing individuality of outline&mdash;like, indeed, the hazy
aureole which painters set on the brow of the man Jesus,
to fix the seal of the ultimate Divinity. Though several or
all of these may be united in the same composition, each
musical work may be characterised in the main as descriptive,
sensuous, suggestive, or dramatic, according as either
element contributes most largely to its purpose. Simple
melody or harmony appeals mostly to the sensuous love of
sweet sounds. The symphony does this in an enlarged and
complicated sense, but is still more marked by the marvellous
suggestive energy with which it unlocks all the secret
raptures of fancy, floods the border-lands of thought with a
glory not to be found on sea or land, and paints ravishing
pictures, that come and go like dreams, with colours drawn
from the &ldquo;twelve-tinted tone-spectrum.&rdquo; Shelley describes
this peculiar influence of music in his &ldquo;Prometheus
Unbound,&rdquo; with exquisite beauty and truth&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;My soul is an enchanted boat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, like a sleeping swan, doth float<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the silver waves of thy sweet singing;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And thine doth like an angel sit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the helm conducting it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While all the waves with melody are ringing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seems to float ever, for ever,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon that many-winding river,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between mountains, woods, abysses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A paradise of wildernesses.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As the symphony best expresses the suggestive potency
in music, the operatic form incarnates its capacity of
definite thought, and the expression of that thought. The
term &ldquo;lyric,&rdquo; as applied to the genuine operatic conception,
is a misnomer. Under the accepted operatic form, however,
it has relative truth, as the main musical purpose of
opera seems, hitherto, to have been less to furnish expression
for exalted emotions and thoughts, or exquisite sentiments,
than to grant the vocal <i>virtuoso</i> opportunity to display
phenomenal qualities of voice and execution. But all
opera, however it may stray from the fundamental idea,
suggests this dramatic element in music, just as mere
lyricism in the poetic art is the blossom from which is
unfolded the full-blown perfection of the word-drama, the
highest form of all poetry.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>That music, by and of itself, cannot express the intellectual
element in the beautiful dream-images of art with
precision, is a palpable truth. Yet, by its imperial dominion
over the sphere of emotion and sentiment, the connection of
the latter with complicated mental phenomena is made to
bring into the domain of tone vague and shifting fancies
and pictures. How much further music can be made to
assimilate to the other arts in directness of mental suggestion,
by wedding to it the noblest forms of poetry, and
making each the complement of the other, is the knotty
problem which underlies the great art-controversy about
which this article concerns itself. On the one side we
have the claim that music is the all-sufficient law unto
itself; that its appeal to sympathy is through the intrinsic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
sweetness of harmony and tune, and the intellect must be
satisfied with what it may accidentally glean in this
harvest-field; that, in the rapture experienced in the
sensuous apperception of its beauty, lies the highest phase
of art-sensibility. Therefore, concludes the syllogism, it
matters nothing as to the character of the libretto or poem
to whose words the music is arranged, so long as the
dramatic framework suffices as a support for the flowery
festoons of song, which drape its ugliness and beguile
attention by the fascinations of bloom and grace. On the
other hand, the apostles of the new musical philosophy
insist that art is something more than a vehicle for the
mere sense of the beautiful, an exquisite provocation wherewith
to startle the sense of a selfish, epicurean pleasure;
that its highest function&mdash;to follow the idea of the Greek
Plato, and the greatest of his modern disciples, Schopenhauer&mdash;is
to serve as the incarnation of the true and the
good; and, even as Goethe makes the Earth-Spirit sing in
&ldquo;Faust&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis thus ever at the loom of Time I ply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weave for God the garment thou seest him by&rdquo;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>so the highest art is that which best embodies the immortal
thought of the universe as reflected in the mirror of man&rsquo;s
consciousness; that music, as speaking the most spiritual
language of any of the art-family, is burdened with the
most pressing responsibility as the interpreter between the
finite and the infinite; that all its forms must be measured
by the earnestness and success with which they teach and
suggest what is best in aspiration and truest in thought;
that music, when wedded to the highest form of poetry (the
drama), produces the consummate art-result, and sacrifices
to some extent its power of suggestion, only to acquire a
greater glory and influence, that of investing definite intellectual
images with spiritual raiment, through which they
shine on the supreme altitudes of ideal thought; that to
make this marriage perfect as an art-form and fruitful in
result, the two partners must come as equals, neither one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
the drudge of the other; that in this organic fusion music
and poetry contribute, each its best, to emancipate art from
its thraldom to that which is merely trivial, commonplace,
and accidental, and make it a revelation of all that is most
exalted in thought, sentiment, and purpose. Such is the
&aelig;sthetic theory of Richard Wagner&rsquo;s art-work.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>It is suggestive to note that the earliest recognised
function of music, before it had learned to enslave itself to
mere sensuous enjoyment, was similar in spirit to that
which its latest reformer demands for it in the art of the
future. The glory of its birth then shone on its brow. It
was the handmaid and minister of the religious instinct.
The imagination became afire with the mystery of life and
Nature, and burst into the flames and frenzies of rhythm.
Poetry was born, but instantly sought the wings of music
for a higher flight than the mere word would permit. Even
the great epics of the &ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; and &ldquo;Odyssey&rdquo; were
originally sung or chanted by the Homerid&aelig;, and the same
essential union seems to have been in some measure
demanded afterwards in the Greek drama, which, at its best,
was always inspired with the religious sentiment. There is
every reason to believe that the chorus of the drama of
&AElig;schylus, Sophocles, and Euripides uttered their comments
on the action of the play with such a prolongation and
variety of pitch in the rhythmic intervals as to constitute a
sustained and melodic recitative. Music at this time was
an essential part of the drama. When the creative genius
of Greece had set towards its ebb, they were divorced, and
music was only set to lyric forms. Such remained the
status of the art till, in the Italian Renaissance, modern
opera was born in the reunion of music and the drama.
Like the other arts, it assumed at the outset to be a mere
revival of antique traditions. The great poets of Italy
had then passed away, and it was left for music to fill the
void.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
The muse, Polyhymnia, soon emerged from the stage of
childish stammering. Guittone di Arezzo taught her to fix
her thoughts in indelible signs, and two centuries of
training culminated in the inspired composers, Orlando di
Lasso and Palestrina. Of the gradual degradation of the
operatic art as its forms became more elaborate and fixed;
of the arbitrary transfer of absolute musical forms like the
aria, duet, finale, etc., into the action of the opera without
regard to poetic propriety; of the growing tendency to
treat the human voice like any other instrument, merely to
show its resources as an organ; of the final utter bondage
of the poet to the musician, till opera became little more
than a congeries of musico-gymnastic forms, wherein the
vocal soloists could display their art, it needs not to speak
at length, for some of these vices have not yet disappeared.
In the language of Dante&rsquo;s guide through the Inferno, at
one stage of their wanderings, when the sights were
peculiarly mournful and desolate&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Non raggioniam da lor, ma guarda e passa.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The loss of all poetic verity and earnestness in opera
furnished the great composer Gluck with the motive of the
bitter and protracted contest which he waged with varying
success throughout Europe, though principally in Paris.
Gluck boldly affirmed, and carried out the principle in his
compositions, that the task of dramatic music was to
accompany the different phases of emotion in the text, and
give them their highest effect of spiritual intensity. The
singer must be the mouthpiece of the poet, and must take
extreme care in giving the full poetical burden of the song.
Thus, the declamatory music became of great importance,
and Gluck&rsquo;s recitative reached an unequalled degree of
perfection.</p>

<p>The critics of Gluck&rsquo;s time hurled at him the same
charges which are familiar to us now as coming from the
mouths and pens of the enemies of Wagner&rsquo;s music. Yet
Gluck, however conscious of the ideal unity between music
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
and poetry, never thought of bringing this about by a
sacrifice of any of the forms of his own peculiar art. His
influence, however, was very great, and the traditions of
the great <i>maestro&rsquo;s</i> art have been kept alive in the works of
his no less great disciples, M&eacute;hul, Cherubini, Spontini, and
Meyerbeer.</p>

<p>Two other attempts to ingraft new and vital power on
the rigid and trivial sentimentality of the Italian forms of
opera were those of Rossini and Weber. The former was
gifted with the greatest affluence of pure melodiousness
ever given to a composer. But even his sparkling originality
and freshness did little more than reproduce the old
forms under a more attractive guise. Weber, on the other
hand, stood in the van of a movement which had its
fountain-head in the strong romantic and national feeling,
pervading the whole of society and literature. There was
a general revival of medi&aelig;val and popular poetry, with its
balmy odour of the woods, and fields, and streams.
Weber&rsquo;s melody was the direct offspring of the tunefulness
of the German <i>Volkslied</i>, and so it expressed, with wonderful
freshness and beauty, all the range of passion and
sentiment within the limits of this pure and simple
language. But the boundaries were far too narrow to
build upon them the ultimate union of music and poetry,
which should express the perfect harmony of the two arts.
While it is true that all of the great German composers
protested, by their works, against the spirit and character
of the Italian school of music, Wagner claims that the first
abrupt and strongly-defined departure towards a radical
reform in art is found in Beethoven&rsquo;s Ninth Symphony
with chorus. Speaking of this remarkable leap from
instrumental to vocal music in a professedly symphonic
composition, Wagner, in his <i>Essay on Beethoven</i>, says&mdash;&ldquo;We
declare that the work of art, which was formed and
quickened entirely by that deed, must present the most
perfect artistic form, <i>i.e.</i>, that form in which, as for the
drama, so also and especially for music, every conventionality
would be abolished.&rdquo; Beethoven is asserted to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
have founded the new musical school, when he admitted,
by his recourse to the vocal cantata in the greatest of his
symphonic works, that he no longer recognised absolute
music as sufficient unto itself.</p>

<p>In Bach and Handel, the great masters of fugue and
counterpoint; in Rossini, Mozart, and Weber, the consummate
creators of melody&mdash;then, according to this view, we
only recognise thinkers in the realm of pure music. In
Beethoven, the greatest of them all, was laid the basis of
the new epoch of tone-poetry. In the immortal songs of
Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn, Liszt, and Franz, and
the symphonies of the first four, the vitality of the
reformatory idea is richly illustrated. In the music-drama
of Wagner, it is claimed by his disciples, is found the full
flower and development of the art-work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Richard Wagner</span>, the formal projector of the
great changes whose details are yet to be sketched, was
born at Leipsic in 1813. As a child he displayed no
very marked artistic tastes, though his ear and memory
for music were quite remarkable. When admitted to the
Kreuzschule of Dresden, the young student, however,
distinguished himself by his very great talent for literary
composition and the classical languages. To this early
culture, perhaps, we are indebted for the great poetic
power which has enabled him to compose the remarkable
libretti which have furnished the basis of his music. His
first creative attempt was a blood-thirsty drama, where
forty-two characters are killed, and the few survivors are
haunted by the ghosts. Young Wagner soon devoted
himself to the study of music, and, in 1833, became a
pupil of Theodor Weinlig, a distinguished teacher of
harmony and counterpoint. His four years of study at this
time were also years of activity in creative experiment,
as he composed four operas.</p>

<p>His first opera of note was &ldquo;Rienzi,&rdquo; with which he
went to Paris in 1837. In spite of Meyerbeer&rsquo;s efforts in
its favour, this work was rejected, and laid aside for some
years. Wagner supported himself by musical criticism
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
and other literary work, and soon was in a position to
offer another opera, &ldquo;Der fliegende Holl&auml;nder,&rdquo; to the
authorities of the Grand Opera-House. Again the directors
refused the work, but were so charmed with the beauty of
the libretto that they bought it to be reset to music.
Until the year 1842, life was a trying struggle for the
indomitable young musician. &ldquo;Rienzi&rdquo; was then produced
at Dresden, so much to the delight of the King of Saxony
that the composer was made royal Kapellmeister and leader
of the orchestra. The production of &ldquo;Der fliegende
Holl&auml;nder&rdquo; quickly followed; next came &ldquo;Tannh&auml;user&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Lohengrin,&rdquo; to be swiftly succeeded by the
&ldquo;Meistersinger von N&uuml;rnberg.&rdquo; This period of our
<i>maestro&rsquo;s</i> musical activity also commenced to witness the
development of his theories on the philosophy of his art,
and some of his most remarkable critical writings were then
given to the world.</p>

<p>Political troubles obliged Wagner to spend seven years of
exile in Zurich; thence he went to London, where he
remained till 1861 as conductor of the London Philharmonic
Society. In 1861 the exile returned to his native country,
and spent several years in Germany and Russia&mdash;there
having arisen quite a <i>furore</i> for his music in the latter
country. The enthusiasm awakened in the breast of King
Louis of Bavaria by &ldquo;Der fliegende Holl&auml;nder&rdquo; resulted
in a summons to Wagner to settle at Munich, and with the
glories of the Royal Opera-House in that city his name has
been principally connected. The culminating art-splendour
of his life, however, was the production of his stupendous
tetralogy, the &ldquo;Ring der Niebelungen,&rdquo; at the great opera-house
at Bayreuth, in the summer of the year 1876.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The first element to be noted in Wagner&rsquo;s operatic
forms is the energetic protest against the artificial and
conventional in music. The utter want of dramatic
symmetry and fitness in the operas we have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
accustomed to hear could only be overlooked by the force
of habit, and the tendency to submerge all else in the mere
enjoyment of the music. The utter variance of music and
poetry was to Wagner the stumbling-block which, first of
all, must be removed. So he crushed at one stroke all the
hard, arid forms which existed in the lyrical drama as it
had been known. His opera, then, is no longer a congeries
of separate musical numbers, like duets, arias, chorals,
and finales, set in a flimsy web of formless recitative,
without reference to dramatic economy. His great purpose
is lofty dramatic truth, and to this end he sacrifices the
whole framework of accepted musical forms, with the
exception of the chorus, and this he remodels. The musical
energy is concentrated in the dialogue as the main factor of
the dramatic problem, and fashioned entirely according to
the requirements of the action. The continuous flow of
beautiful melody takes the place alike of the dry recitative
and the set musical forms which characterise the accepted
school of opera. As the dramatic <i>motif</i> demands, this
&ldquo;continuous melody&rdquo; rises into the highest ecstasies of the
lyrical fervour, or ebbs into a chant-like swell of subdued
feeling, like the ocean after the rush of the storm. If
Wagner has destroyed musical forms, he has also added a
positive element. In place of the aria we have the <i>logos</i>.
This is the musical expression of the principal passion
underlying the action of the drama. Whenever, in the
course of the development of the story, this passion comes
into ascendency, the rich strains of the <i>logos</i> are heard
anew, stilling all other sounds. Gounod has, in part,
applied this principle in &ldquo;Faust.&rdquo; All opera-goers will
remember the intense dramatic effect arising from the
recurrence of the same exquisite lyric outburst from the
lips of Marguerite.</p>

<p>The peculiar character of Wagner&rsquo;s word-drama next
arouses critical interest and attention. The composer is
his own poet, and his creative genius shines no less here
than in the world of tone. The musical energy flows
entirely from the dramatic conditions, like the electrical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
current from the cups of the battery; and the rhythmical
structure of the <i>melos</i> (tune) is simply the transfiguration
of the poetical basis. The poetry, then, is all-important in
the music-drama. Wagner has rejected the forms of blank
verse and rhyme as utterly unsuited to the lofty purposes
of music, and has gone to the metrical principle of all the
Teutonic and Slavonic poetry. This rhythmic element of
alliteration, or <i>staffrhyme</i>, we find magnificently illustrated
in the Scandinavian Eddas, and even in our own Anglo-Saxon
fragments of the days of C&aelig;dmon and Alcuin. By
the use of this new form, verse and melody glide together
in one exquisite rhythm, in which it seems impossible to
separate the one from the other. The strong accent of the
alliterating syllables supply the music with firmness, while
the low-toned syllables give opportunity for the most varied
<i>nuances</i> of declamation.</p>

<p>The first radical development of Wagner&rsquo;s theories we
see in &ldquo;The Flying Dutchman.&rdquo; In &ldquo;Tannh&auml;user&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Lohengrin&rdquo; they find full sway. The utter revolt of his
mind from the trivial and commonplace sentimentalities of
Italian opera led him to believe that the most heroic and
lofty motives alone should furnish the dramatic foundation
of opera. For a while he oscillated between history and
legend, as best adapted to furnish his material. In his
selection of the dream-land of myth and legend, we may
detect another example of the profound and <i>exigeant</i> art-instincts
which have ruled the whole of Wagner&rsquo;s life.
There could be no question as to the utter incongruity of
any dramatic picture of ordinary events, or ordinary personages,
finding expression in musical utterance. Genuine
and profound art must always be consistent with itself, and
what we recognise as general truth. Even characters set
in the comparatively near background of history are too
closely related to our own familiar surroundings of thought
and mood to be regarded as artistically natural in the use
of music as the organ of the every-day life of emotion and
sentiment. But with the dim and heroic shapes that haunt
the border-land of the supernatural, which we call legend,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
the case is far different. This is the drama of the demigods,
living in a different atmosphere from our own, however
akin to ours may be their passions and purposes. For
these we are no longer compelled to regard the medium of
music as a forced and untruthful expression, for do they
not dwell in the magic lands of the imagination? All
sense of dramatic inconsistency instantly vanishes, and the
conditions of artistic illusion are perfect.</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis distance lends enchantment to the view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clothes the mountains with their azure hue.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus all of Wagner&rsquo;s works, from &ldquo;Der fliegende Holl&auml;nder&rdquo;
to the &ldquo;Ring der Niebelungen,&rdquo; have been located
in the world of myth, in obedience to a profound art-principle.
The opera of &ldquo;Tristan and Iseult,&rdquo; first performed
in 1865, announced Wagner&rsquo;s absolute emancipation,
both in the construction of music and poetry, from
the time-honoured and time-corrupted canons, and, aside
from the last great work, it may be received as the most
perfect representation of his school.</p>

<p>The third main feature in the Wagner music is the wonderful
use of the orchestra as a factor in the solution of the
art-problem. This is no longer a mere accompaniment to
the singer, but translates the passion of the play into a
grand symphony, running parallel and commingling with
the vocal music. Wagner, as a great master of orchestration,
has had few equals since Beethoven; and he uses his
power with marked effect to heighten the dramatic intensity
of the action, and at the same time to convey certain
meanings which can only find vent in the vague and indistinct
forms of pure music. The romantic conception of the
medi&aelig;val love, the shudderings and raptures of Christian
revelation, have certain phases that absolute music alone
can express. The orchestra, then, becomes as much an
integral part of the music-drama, in its actual current
movement, as the chorus or the leading performers. Placed
on the stage, yet out of sight, its strains might almost be
fancied the sound of the sympathetic communion of good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
and evil spirits, with whose presence mystics formerly
claimed man was constantly surrounded. Wagner&rsquo;s use
of the orchestra may be illustrated from the opera of
&ldquo;Lohengrin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ideal background, from which the emotions of the
human actors in the drama are reflected with supernatural
light, is the conception of the &ldquo;Holy Graal,&rdquo; the mystic
symbol of the Christian faith, and its descent from the
skies, guarded by hosts of seraphim. This is the subject of
the orchestral prelude, and never have the sweetnesses and
terrors of the Christian ecstasy been more potently expressed.
The prelude opens with long-drawn chords of the
violins, in the highest octaves, in the most exquisite <i>pianissimo</i>.
The inner eye of the spirit discerns in this the suggestion
of shapeless white clouds, hardly discernible from
the a&euml;rial blue of the sky. Suddenly the strings seem to
sound from the farthest distance, in continued <i>pianissimo</i>,
and the melody, the Graal-motive, takes shape. Gradually,
to the fancy, a group of angels seem to reveal themselves,
slowly descending from the heavenly heights, and bearing
in their midst the <i>Sangr&eacute;al</i>. The modulations throb
through the air, augmenting in richness and sweetness, till
the <i>fortissimo</i> of the full orchestra reveals the sacred mystery.
With this climax of spiritual ecstasy the harmonious
waves gradually recede and ebb away in dying sweetness,
as the angels return to their heavenly abode. This orchestral
movement recurs in the opera, according to the laws
of dramatic fitness, and its melody is heard also in the
<i>logos</i> of Lohengrin, the knight of the Graal, to express
certain phases of his action. The immense power which
music is thus made to have in dramatic effect can easily be
fancied.</p>

<p>A fourth prominent characteristic of the Wagner music-drama
is that, to develop its full splendour, there must be a
co-operation of all the arts, painting, sculpture, and architecture,
as well as poetry and music. Therefore, in realising
its effects, much importance rests in the visible beauties of
action, as they may be expressed by the painting of scenery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
and the grouping of human figures. Well may such a grand
conception be called the &ldquo;Art-work of the Future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wagner for a long time despaired of the visible execution
of his ideas. At last the celebrated pianist, Tausig, suggested
an appeal to the admirers of the new music
throughout the world for means to carry out the composer&rsquo;s
great ideas&mdash;viz., to perform the &ldquo;Niebelungen&rdquo; at a
theatre to be erected for the purpose, and by a select company,
in the manner of a national festival, and before an
audience entirely removed from the atmosphere of vulgar
theatrical shows. After many delays Wagner&rsquo;s hopes were
attained, and in the summer of 1876 a gathering of the
principal celebrities of Europe was present to criticise the
fully perfected fruit of the composer&rsquo;s theories and genius.
This festival was so recent, and its events have been the
subject of such elaborate comment, that further description
will be out of place here.</p>

<p>As a great musical poet, rather epic than dramatic in his
powers, there can be no question as to Wagner&rsquo;s rank.
The performance of the &ldquo;Niebelungenring,&rdquo; covering
&ldquo;Rheingold,&rdquo; &ldquo;Die Walk&uuml;ren,&rdquo; &ldquo;Siegfried,&rdquo; and &ldquo;G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung,&rdquo;
was one of the epochs of musical Germany.
However deficient Wagner&rsquo;s skill in writing for the human
voice, the power and symmetry of his conceptions, and his
genius in embodying them in massive operatic forms, are
such as to storm even the prejudices of his opponents. The
poet-musician rightfully claims that in his music-drama is
found that wedding of two of the noblest of the arts,
pregnantly suggested by Shakespeare:&mdash;</p>

<span class="smcap">Note by the Editor.</span>&mdash;The knowledge of Wagner&rsquo;s music in
England originated chiefly with the masterly playing of Herr Von
B&uuml;low, with the concerts given by Messrs. Dannreuther and
Bache, and later on by the Wagner festival held at the Albert
Hall in 1877, where Wagner himself presided at the performance of
the music of his <i>Ring des Niebelungen</i>. He was not quite satisfied
with its reception; but this is not altogether to be wondered at when
we consider that the work was divorced from its scenic adjuncts, and
that in his operas&mdash;in accordance with his own theory&mdash;the plastic
arts as well as poetry and music are equally required to produce a
well-balanced result. None the less, this festival greatly increased the
interest in &ldquo;the Music of the Future;&rdquo; and in 1880 <i>The Ring des
Niebelungen</i> was performed at Covent Garden, while his other
operas were given in their proper sequence at Drury Lane. In 1882
his last great work, <i>Parsifal</i>, was performed with striking &eacute;clat at
Bayreuth. On the 18th of February 1883 he died of heart disease at
Venice, whither he had gone to recruit his health. A personal friend
has recorded that Wagner&rsquo;s body was laid in the coffin by the widow
herself, who&mdash;as a last token of her love and admiration&mdash;cut off the
beautiful hair her husband had so admired, and placed it on a red
cushion under the head of the departed. The body of the great
musician was taken to Bayreuth and buried, in accordance with the
wishes he had himself expressed, in the garden of his own house,
&ldquo;Vahnfried.&rdquo; A large wreath from the King of Bavaria lay on the
coffin, bearing the appropriate inscription&mdash;&ldquo;To the Deathless One.&rdquo;
On the 24th of July in the same year, <i>Parsifal</i> was again
performed at Bayreuth&mdash;a fitting requiem service over the great
master. <i>Parsifal</i> is the culmination of Wagner&rsquo;s epic work. In
it he completes the cycle of myths by which he strove to express
the varied and fervent aspirations of humanity; and in particular
&ldquo;the two burning questions of the day&mdash;1. The Tremendous Empire
of the Senses. 2. The Immense Supremacy of Soul; and how to
reconcile them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Legend of the Sangrail, the <i>motif</i> of his last work, is &ldquo;the
most poetic and pathetic form of transubstantiation; ... it possesses
the true legendary power of attraction and assimilation.&rdquo; In
Mr. Haweis&rsquo; words, &ldquo;The <i>Tannh&auml;user</i> and the <i>Lohengrin</i> are the two
first of the legendary dramas which serve to illustrate the Christian
Chivalry and religious aspirations of the middle ages, in conflict
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
on the one side with the narrow ideals of Catholicism, and on the
other with the free instincts of human nature. <i>Parsifal</i> forms with
them a great Trilogy of Christian legends, as the <i>Ring of the
Niebelungen</i> forms a Tetralogy of Pagan, Rhine, and Norse legends.
Both series of sacred and profane myths in the hands of Wagner, whilst
striking the great key-notes, Paganism and Catholicism, become the
fitting and appropriate vehicles for the display of the ever-recurrent
struggles of the human heart&mdash;now in the grip of inexorable fate, now
passion-tossed, at war with itself and with time&mdash;soothed with spaces
of calm&mdash;flattered with the dream of ineffable joys&mdash;filled with sublime
hopes; and content at last with far-off glimpses of God.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="padtop"><a name="palestrina" id="palestrina"></a><i>PALESTRINA.</i></h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="dcapt2"><span class="dcap">T</span></span>HE Netherlands share other glories than that of
having nursed the most indomitable spirit of
liberty known to medi&aelig;val Europe. The fine
as well as the industrial arts found among this
remarkable people, distinguished by Erasmus
as possessed of the <i>patientia laboris</i>, an eager and passionate
culture. The early contributions of the Low
Countries to the growth of the pictorial art are well known
to all. But to most it will be a revelation that the Belgian
school of music was the great fructifying influence of the
fifteenth century, to which Italy and Germany owe a debt
not easily measured. The art of interweaving parts and
that science of sound known as counterpoint were placed by
this school of musical scholars and workers on a solid basis,
which enabled the great composers who came after them to
build their beautiful tone fabrics in forms of imperishable
beauty and symmetry. For a long time most of the great
Italian churches had Belgian chapel-masters, and the value
of their example and teachings was vital in its relation to
Italian music.</p>

<p>The last great master among the Belgians, and, after
Palestrina, the greatest of the sixteenth century, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
Orlando di Lasso, born in Hainault, in the year 1520. His
life of a little more than three score years and ten was
divided between Italy and Germany. He left the deep
imprint of his severe style, though but a young man, on his
Italian <i>confr&egrave;res</i>, and the young Palestrina owed to him
much of the largeness and beauty of form through which
he poured his genius in the creation of such works as have
given him so distinct a place in musical history. The pope
created Orlando di Lasso Knight of the Golden Spur, and
sought to keep him in Italy. Unconcerned as to fame, the
gentle, peaceful musician lived for his art alone, and the
flattering expressions of the great were not so much enjoyed
as endured by him. A musical historian, Heimsoeth, says
of him&mdash;&ldquo;He is the brilliant master of the North, great
and sublime in sacred composition, of inexhaustible invention,
displaying much breadth, variety, and depth in his
treatment; he delights in full and powerful harmonies, yet,
after all&mdash;owing to an existence passed in journeys, as well
as service at court, and occupied at the same time with both
sacred and secular music&mdash;he came short of that lofty,
solemn tone which pervades the works of the great master
of the South, Palestrina, who, with advancing years,
restricted himself more and more to church music.&rdquo; Of
the celebrated penitential psalms of Di Lasso, it is said that
Charles IX. of France ordered them to be written &ldquo;in
order to obtain rest for his soul after the terrible massacre
of St. Bartholomew.&rdquo; Aside from his works, this musician
has a claim on fame through his lasting improvements in
musical form and method. He illuminated, and at the
same time closed, the great epoch of Belgian ascendancy,
which had given three hundred musicians of great science
to the times in which they lived. So much has been said
of Orlando di Lasso, for he was the model and Mentor of
the greatest of early church composers, Palestrina.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span></p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The melodious and fascinating style, soon to give birth
to the characteristic genius of the opera, was as yet unborn,
though dormant. In Rome, the chief seat of the Belgian art,
the exclusive study of technical skill had frozen music to a
mere formula. The Gregorian chant had become so overladen
with mere embellishments as to make the prescribed
church-form difficult of recognition in its borrowed garb, for
it had become a mere jumble of sound. Musicians, indeed,
carried their profanation so far as to take secular melodies
as the themes for masses and motetts. These were often
called by their profane titles. So the name of a love-sonnet
or a drinking-song would sometimes be attached to a
<i>miserere</i>. The Council of Trent, in 1562, cut at these evils
with sweeping axe, and the solemn anathemas of the church
fathers roused the creative powers of the subject of this
sketch, who raised his art to an independent national
existence, and made it rank with sculpture and painting,
which had already reached their zenith in Leonardo da
Vinci, Raphael, Correggio, Titian, and Michael Angelo.
Henceforth Italian music was to be a vigorous, fruitful
stock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giovanni Perluigi Aloisio da Palestrina</span> was born at
Palestrina, the ancient Pr&aelig;neste, in 1524.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> The memorials
of his childhood are scanty. We know but little except
that his parents were poor peasants, and that he learned
the rudiments of literature and music as a choir-singer, a
starting-point so common in the lives of great composers.
In 1540 he went to Rome and studied in the school of
Goudimel, a stern Huguenot Fleming, tolerated in the
papal capital on account of his superior science and method
of teaching, and afterwards murdered at Lyons on the day
of the Paris massacre. Palestrina grasped the essential
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
doctrines of the school without adopting its mannerisms.
At the age of thirty he published his first compositions,
and dedicated them to the reigning pontiff, Julius III. In
the formation of his style, which moved with such easy,
original grace within the old prescribed rules, he learned
much from the personal influence and advice of Orlando di
Lasso, his warm friend and constant companion during these
earlier days.</p>

<p>Several of his compositions, written at this time, are still
performed in Rome on Good Friday, and Goethe and
Mendelssohn have left their eloquent tributes to the
impression made on them by music alike simple and
sublime. The pope was highly pleased with Palestrina&rsquo;s
noble music, and appointed him one of the papal choristers,
then regarded as a great honour. But beyond Rome the
new light of music was but little known. The Council of
Trent, in their first indignation at the abuse of church
music, had resolved to abolish everything but the simple
Gregorian chants, but the remonstrances of the Emperor
Ferdinand and the Roman cardinals stayed the austere fiat.
The final decision was made to rest on a new composition
of Palestrina, who was permitted to demonstrate that the
higher forms of musical art were consistent with the
solemnities of church worship.</p>

<p>All eyes were directed to the young musician, for the
very existence of his art was at stake. The motto of his
first mass, &ldquo;Illumina oculos meos,&rdquo; shows the pious
enthusiasm with which he undertook his labours. Instead
of one, he composed three six-part masses. The third of
these excited such admiration that the pope exclaimed
in raptures, &ldquo;It is John who gives us here in this earthly
Jerusalem a foretaste of that new song which the holy
Apostle John realised in the heavenly Jerusalem in his
prophetic trance.&rdquo; This is now known as the &ldquo;mass of
Pope Marcel,&rdquo; in honour of a former patron of Palestrina.</p>

<p>A new pope, Paul IV., on ascending the pontifical
throne, carried his desire of reforming abuses to fanaticism.
He insisted on all the papal choristers being clerical.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
Palestrina had married early in life a Roman lady, of whom
all we know is that her name was Lucretia. Four children
had blessed the union, and the composer&rsquo;s domestic happiness
became a bar to his temporal preferment. With two
others he was dismissed from the chapel because he was a
layman, and a trifling pension allowed him. Two months
afterwards, though, he was appointed chapel-master of St.
John Lateran. His works now succeeded each other
rapidly, and different collections of his masses were
dedicated to the crowned heads of Europe. In 1571 he
was appointed chapel-master of the Vatican, and Pope
Gregory XIII. gave special charge of the reform of sacred
music to Palestrina.</p>

<p>The death of the composer&rsquo;s wife, whom he idolised, in
1580, was a blow from which he never recovered. In his
latter days he was afflicted with great poverty, for the
positions he held were always more honourable than lucrative.
Mental depression and physical weakness burdened
the last few years of his pious and gentle life, and he died
after a lingering and severe illness. The register of the
pontifical chapel contains this entry&mdash;&ldquo;February 2, 1594.
This morning died the most excellent musician, Signor
Giovanni Palestrina, our dear companion and <i>maestro di
capella</i> of St. Peter&rsquo;s church, whither his funeral was
attended not only by all the musicians of Rome, but by an
infinite concourse of people, when his own &lsquo;Libera me,
Domine&rsquo; was sung by the whole college.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such are the simple and meagre records of the life of the
composer who carved and laid the foundation of the superstructure
of Italian music; who, viewed in connection with
his times and their limitations, must be regarded as one of
the great creative minds in his art; who shares with
Sebastian Bach the glory of having built an imperishable
base for the labours of his successors.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Palestrina left a great mass of compositions, all glowing
with the fire of genius, only part of which have been
published. His simple life was devoted to musical labour,
and passed without romance, diversion, or excitement.
His works are marked by utter absence of contrast and
colour. Without dramatic movement, they are full of
melody and majesty&mdash;a majesty serene, unruffled by the
slightest suggestion of human passion. Voices are now
and then used for individual expression, but either in
unison or harmony. As in all great church music, the
chorus is the key of the work. The general judgment of
musicians agrees that repose and enjoyment are more
characteristic of this music than that of any other master.
The choir of the Sistine chapel, by the inheritance of long-cherished
tradition, is the most perfect exponent of the
Palestrina music. During the annual performance of the
&ldquo;Improperie&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lamentations,&rdquo; the altar and walls are
despoiled of their pictures and ornaments, and everything
is draped in black. The cardinals dressed in serge, no
incense, no candles: the whole scene is a striking picture
of trouble and desolation. The faithful come in two by
two and bow before the cross, while the sad music reverberates
through the chapel arches. This powerful appeal
to the imagination, of course, lends greater power to the
musical effect. But all minds who have felt the lift and
beauty of these compositions have acknowledged how far
they soar above words and creeds, and the picturesque
framework of a liturgy.</p>

<p>Mendelssohn, in a letter to Zelter on the Palestrina
music as heard in the Sistine chapel, says that nothing
could exceed the effect of the blending of the voices, the
prolonged tones gradually merging from one note and chord
to another, softly swelling, decreasing, at last dying out.
&ldquo;They understand,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;how to bring out and
place each trait in the most delicate light, without giving it
undue prominence; one chord gently melts into another.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
The ceremony at the same time is solemn and imposing;
deep silence prevails in the chapel, only broken by the
re-echoing Greek &lsquo;holy,&rsquo; sung with unvarying sweetness and
expression.&rdquo; The composer Paer was so impressed with the
wonderful beauty of the music and the performance, that
he exclaimed, &ldquo;This is indeed divine music, such as I have
long sought for, and my imagination was never able to
realise, but which, I knew, must exist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Palestrina&rsquo;s versatility and genius enabled him to lift
ecclesiastical music out of the rigidity and frivolity characterising
on either hand the opposing ranks of those that
preceded him, and to embody the religious spirit in works
of the highest art. He transposed the ecclesiastical melody
(<i>canto fermo</i>) from the tenor to the soprano (thus rendering
it more intelligible to the ear), and created that glorious
thing choir song, with its refined harmony, that noble music
of which his works are the models, and the papal chair the
oracle. No individual pre-eminence is ever allowed to
disturb and weaken the ideal atmosphere of the whole
work. However Palestrina&rsquo;s successors have aimed to
imitate his effects, they have, with the exception of
Cherubini, failed for the most part; for every peculiar
genus of art is the result of innate genuine inspiration,
and the spontaneous growth of the age which produces
it. As a parent of musical form he was the protagonist of
Italian music, both sacred and secular, and left an admirable
model, which even the new school of opera so soon to
rise found it necessary to follow in the construction of
harmony. The splendid and often licentious music of the
theatre built its most worthy effects on the work of the
pious composer, who lived, laboured, and died in an
atmosphere of almost anchorite sanctity.</p>

<p>The great disciples of his school, Nannini and Allegri,
continued his work, and the splendid &ldquo;Miserere&rdquo; of the
latter was regarded as such an inestimable treasure that no
copy of it was allowed to go out of the Sistine chapel, till
the infant prodigy, Wolfgang Mozart, wrote it out from
the memory of a single hearing.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Music</span>, as speaking the language of feeling, emotion, and
passion, found its first full expansion in the operatic form.
There had been attempts to represent drama with chorus,
founded on the ancient Greek drama, but it was soon discovered
that dialogue and monologue could not be embodied
in choral forms without involving an utter absurdity. The
spirit of the renaissance had freed poetry, statuary, and
painting from the monopolising claims of the church.
Music, which had become a well-equipped and developed
science, could not long rest in a similar servitude. Though
it is not the aim of the author to discuss operatic history, a
brief survey of the progress of opera from its birth cannot
be omitted.</p>

<p>The oldest of the entertainments which ripened into
Italian opera belongs to the last years of the fifteenth
century, and was the work of the brilliant Politian, known
as one of the revivalists of Greek learning attached to the
court of Cosmo de&rsquo; Medici and his son Lorenzo. This was
the musical drama of &ldquo;Orfeo.&rdquo; The story was written in
Latin, and sung in music principally choral, though a few
solo phrases were given to the principal characters. It was
performed at Rome with great magnificence, and Vasari tells
us that Peruzzi, the decorator of the papal theatre, painted
such scenery for it that even the great Titian was so struck
with the <i>vraisemblance</i> of the work that he was not satisfied
until he had touched the canvas to be sure of its not being
in relief. We may fancy indeed that the scenery was one
great attraction of the representation. In spite of spasmodic
encouragement by the more liberally-minded pontiffs,
the general weight of church influence was against the new
musical tendency, and the most skilled composers were at
first afraid to devote their talents to further its growth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
What musicians did not dare undertake out of dread of
the thunderbolts of the church, a company of <i>literati</i> at
Florence commenced in 1580. The primary purpose was
the revival of Greek art, including music. This association,
in conjunction with the Medicean Academy, laid down the
rule that distinct individuality of expression in music was
to be sought for. As results, quickly came musical drama
with recitative (modern form of the Greek chorus) and solo
melody for characteristic parts of the legend or story. Out
of this beginning swiftly grew the opera. Composers in
the new form sprung up in various parts of Italy, though
Naples, Venice, and Florence continued to be its centres.</p>

<p>Between 1637 and 1700 there were performed three
hundred operas at Venice alone. An account of the performance
of &ldquo;Berenice,&rdquo; composed by Domenico Freschi, at
Padua, in 1680, dwarfs all our present ideas of spectacular
splendour. In this opera there were choruses of a hundred
virgins and a hundred soldiers; a hundred horsemen in steel
armour; a hundred performers on trumpets, cornets, sackbuts,
drums, flutes, and other instruments, on horseback and
on foot; two lions led by two Turks, and two elephants
led by two Indians; Berenice&rsquo;s triumphal car drawn by
four horses, and six other cars with spoils and prisoners,
drawn by twelve horses. Among the scenes in the first act
was a vast plain with two triumphal arches; another with
pavilions and tents; a square prepared for the entrance of
the triumphal procession, and a forest for the chase. In
the second act there were the royal apartments of
Berenice&rsquo;s temple of vengeance, a spacious court with
view of the prison and a covered way with long lines of
chariots. In the third act there were the royal dressing-room,
the stables with a hundred live horses, porticoes
adorned with tapestry, and a great palace in the perspective.
In the course of the piece there were representations
of the hunting of the boar, the stag, and the lions.
The whole concluded with a huge globe descending from
the skies, and dividing itself in lesser globes of fire, on
which stood allegorical figures of fame, honour, nobility,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
virtue, and glory. The theatrical manager had princes and
nobles for bankers and assistants, and they lavished their
treasures of art and money to make such spectacles as the
modern stagemen of London and Paris cannot approach.</p>

<p>In Evelyn&rsquo;s diary there is an entry describing opera at
Venice in 1645:&mdash;&ldquo;This night, having with my lord Bruce
taken our places before, we went to the opera, where
comedies and other plays are represented in recitative
music by the most excellent musicians, vocal and instrumental,
with variety of scenes painted and contrived with
no lesse art of perspective, and machines for flying in the
aire, and other wonderful motions; taken together it is one
of the most magnificent and expensive diversions the wit
of man can invent. The history was Hercules in Lydia.
The sceanes changed thirteen times. The famous voices,
Anna Rencia, a Roman, and reputed the best treble of
women; but there was a Eunuch who in my opinion
surpassed her; also a Genoise that in my judgment sung
an incomparable base. They held us by the eyes and ears
till two o&rsquo;clock i&rsquo; the morning.&rdquo; Again he writes of the
carnival of 1646:&mdash;&ldquo;The comedians have liberty and the
operas are open; witty pasquils are thrown about, and the
mountebanks have their stages at every corner. The
diversion which chiefly took me up was three noble operas,
where were most excellent voices and music, the most
celebrated of which was the famous and beautiful Anna
Rencia, whom we invited to a fish dinner after four daies
in Lent, when they had given over at the theatre.&rdquo; Old
Evelyn then narrates how he and his noble friend took the
lovely diner out on a junketing, and got shot at with
blunderbusses from the gondola of an infuriated rival.</p>

<p>Opera progressed towards a fixed status with a swiftness
hardly paralleled in the history of any art. The soil was
rich and fully prepared for the growth, and the fecund root,
once planted, shot into a luxuriant beauty and symmetry,
which nothing could check. The Church wisely gave up its
opposition, and henceforth there was nothing to impede the
progress of a product which spread and naturalised itself in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
England, France, and Germany. The inventive genius of
Monteverde, Carissimi, Scarlatti (the friend and rival of
Handel), Durante, and Leonardo Leo, perfected the forms
of the opera nearly as we have them to-day. A line of
brilliant composers in the school of Durante and Leo brings
us down through Pergolesi, Derni, Terradiglias, Jomelli,
Traetta, Ciccio di Majo, Galluppi, and Giuglielmi, to the
most distinguished of the early Italian composers, Niccolo
Piccini, who, mostly forgotten in his works, is principally
known to modern fame as the rival of the mighty Gluck in
that art controversy which shook Paris into such bitter
factions. Yet, overshadowed as Piccini was in the greatness
of his rival, there can be no question of his desert as
the most brilliant ornament and exponent of the early
operatic school. No greater honour could have been paid
to him than that he should have been chosen as their
champion by the <i>Italianissimi</i> of his day in the battle royal
with such a giant as Gluck, an honour richly deserved by a
composer distinguished by multiplicity and beauty of ideas,
dramatic insight, and ardent conviction.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Niccolo Piccini</span>, who was not less than fifty years of
age when he left Naples for the purpose of outrivalling
Gluck, was born at Bari, in the kingdom of Naples, in
1728. His father, also a musician, had destined him for
holy orders, but Nature made him an artist. His great
delight even as a little child was playing on the harpsichord,
which he quickly learned. One day the bishop of
Bari heard him playing, and was amazed at the power of
the little <i>virtuoso</i>. &ldquo;By all means send him to a conservatory
of music,&rdquo; he said to the elder Piccini. &ldquo;If the
vocation of the priesthood brings trials and sacrifices, a
musical career is not less beset with obstacles. Music
demands great perseverance and incessant labour. It
exposes one to many chagrins and toils.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the advice of the shrewd prelate, the precocious boy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
was placed at the school of St. Onofrio at the age of fourteen.
At first confided to the care of an inferior professor,
he revolted from the arid teachings of a mere human
machine. Obeying the dictates of his daring fancy, though
hardly acquainted with the rudiments of composition, he
determined to compose a mass. The news got abroad that
the little Niccolo was working on a grand mass, and the
great Leo, the chief of the conservatory, sent for the
trembling culprit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have written a mass?&rdquo; he commenced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, sir, I could not help it,&rdquo; said the timid boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Niccolo brought him the score and all the orchestral
parts, and Leo immediately went to the concert-room,
assembled the orchestra, and gave them the parts.
The boy was ordered to take his place in front and conduct
the performance, which he went through with great
agitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pardon you this time,&rdquo; said the grave <i>maestro</i>, at the
end; &ldquo;but, if you do such a thing again, I will punish you
in such a manner that you will remember it as long as you
live. Instead of studying the principles of your art, you
give yourself up to all the wildness of your imagination;
and, when you have tutored your ill-regulated ideas into
something like shape, you produce what you call a mass,
and no doubt think you have produced a masterpiece.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the boy burst into tears at this rebuke, Leo
clasped him in his arms, told him he had great talent, and
after that took him under his special instruction. Leo
was succeeded by Durante, who also loved Piccini, and
looked forward to a future greatness for him. He was
wont to say the others were his pupils, but Piccini was his
son. After twelve years spent in the conservatory, Piccini
commenced an opera. The director of the principal
Neapolitan theatre said to Prince Vintimille, who introduced
the young musician, that his work was sure to be
a failure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much can you lose by his opera,&rdquo; the prince replied,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
&ldquo;supposing it to be a perfect fiasco?&rdquo; The manager named
the sum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is the money, then,&rdquo; replied Piccini&rsquo;s generous
patron, handing him a purse. &ldquo;If the &lsquo;Dorme Despetose&rsquo;&rdquo;
(the name of the opera) &ldquo;should fail, you may keep the
money, but otherwise return it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The friends of Lagroscino, the favourite composer of the
day, were enraged when they heard that the next new work
was to be from an obscure youth, and they determined to
hiss the performance. So great, however, was the delight
of the public with the freshness and beauty of Piccini&rsquo;s
music, that even those who came to condemn remained to
applaud. The reputation of the composer went on increasing
until he became the foremost name of musical Italy, for
his fertility of production was remarkable; and he gave the
theatres a brilliant succession of comic and serious works.
In 1758 he produced at Rome his &ldquo;Alessandro nell&rsquo;
Indie,&rdquo; whose success surpassed all that had preceded it,
and two years later a still finer masterpiece, &ldquo;La Buona
Figluola,&rdquo; written to a text furnished by the poet Goldoni,
and founded on the story of Richardson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pamela.&rdquo; This
opera was produced at every playhouse on the Italian
peninsula in the course of a few years.</p>

<p>A pleasant <i>mot</i> by the Duke of Brunswick is worth preserving
in this connection. Piccini had married a beautiful
singer named Vicenza Sibilla, and his home was very
happy. One day the German prince visited Piccini, and
found him rocking the cradle of his youngest child, while
the eldest was tugging at the paternal coat-tails. The
mother, being <i>en d&eacute;shabille</i>, ran away at the sight of a
stranger. The duke excused himself for his want of
ceremony, and added, &ldquo;I am delighted to see so great a
man living in such simplicity, and that the author of &lsquo;La
Bonne Fille&rsquo; is such a good father.&rdquo; Piccini&rsquo;s placid and
pleasant life was destined, however, to pass into stormy
waters.</p>

<p>His sway over the stage and the popular preference
continued until 1773, when a clique of envious rivals at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
Rome brought about his first disaster. The composer was
greatly disheartened, and took to his bed, for he was ill
alike in mind and body. The turning-point in his
career had come, and he was to enter into an arena which
taxed his powers in a contest such as he had not yet
dreamed of. His operas having been heard and admired in
France, their great reputation inspired the royal favourite,
Mdme. du Barry, with the hope of finding a successful
competitor to the great German composer, patronised by
Marie Antoinette. Accordingly, Piccini was offered an
indemnity of six thousand francs, and a residence in the
hotel of the Neapolitan ambassador. When the Italian
arrived in Paris, Gluck was in full sway, the idol of the
court and public, and about to produce his &ldquo;Armide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Piccini was immediately commissioned to write a new
opera, and he applied to the brilliant Marmontel for a
libretto. The poet rearranged one of Quinault&rsquo;s tragedies,
&ldquo;Roland,&rdquo; and Piccini undertook the difficult task of
composing music to words in a language as yet unknown to
him. Marmontel was his unwearied tutor, and he writes in
his &ldquo;Memoirs&rdquo; of his pleasant yet arduous task&mdash;&ldquo;Line by
line, word by word, I had everything to explain; and, when
he had laid hold of the meaning of a passage, I recited it to
him, marking the accent, the prosody, and the cadence of
the verses. He listened eagerly, and I had the satisfaction
to know that what he heard was carefully noted. His
delicate ear seized so readily the accent of the language and
the measure of the poetry, that in his music he never
mistook them. It was an inexpressible pleasure to me to
see him practice before my eyes an art of which before
I had no idea. His harmony was in his mind. He
wrote his airs with the utmost rapidity, and when he had
traced its designs, he filled up all the parts of the score,
distributing the traits of harmony and melody, just as a
skilful painter would distribute on his canvas the colours,
lights, and shadows of his picture. When all this was
done, he opened his harpsichord, which he had been using
as his writing-table; and then I heard an air, a duet, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
chorus, complete in all its parts, with a truth of expression,
an intelligence, a unity of design, a magic in the harmony,
which delighted both my ear and my feelings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Piccini&rsquo;s arrival in Paris had been kept a close secret
while he was working on the new opera, but Abb&eacute; du Rollet
ferreted it out, and acquainted Gluck, which piece of news
the great German took with philosophical disdain. Indeed,
he attended the rehearsal of &ldquo;Roland;&rdquo; and when his rival,
in despair over his ignorance of French and the stupidity of
the orchestra, threw down the baton in despair, Gluck took
it up, and by his magnetic authority brought order out of
chaos and restored tranquillity, a help as much, probably,
the fruit of condescension and contempt as of generosity.</p>

<p>Still Gluck was not easy in mind over this intrigue of his
enemies, and wrote a bitter letter, which was made public,
and aggravated the war of public feeling. Epigrams and
accusations flew back and forth like hailstones.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know that the Chevalier (Gluck&rsquo;s title) has an
Armida and Orlando in his portfolio?&rdquo; said Abb&eacute; Arnaud
to a Piccinist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Piccini is also at work on an Orlando,&rdquo; was the
retort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; returned the abb&eacute;, &ldquo;for then we
shall have an Orlando and also an Orlandino,&rdquo; was the keen
answer.</p>

<p>The public attention was stimulated by the war of
pamphlets, lampoons, and newspaper articles. Many of the
great <i>literati</i> were Piccinists, among them Marmontel,
La Harpe, D&rsquo;Alembert, etc. Suard du Rollet and Jean
Jacques Rousseau fought in the opposite ranks. Although
the nation was trembling on the verge of revolution, and
the French had just lost their hold on the East Indies;
though Mirabeau was thundering in the tribune, and Jacobin
clubs were commencing their baleful work, soon to drench
Paris in blood, all factions and discords were forgotten.
The question was no longer, &ldquo;Is he a Jansenist, a Molinist,
an Encyclop&aelig;dist, a philosopher, a free-thinker?&rdquo; One
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
question only was thought of, &ldquo;Is he a Gluckist or
Piccinist?&rdquo; and on the answer often depended the peace of
families and the cement of long-established friendships.</p>

<p>Piccini&rsquo;s opera was a brilliant success with the fickle
Parisians, though the Gluckists sneered at it as pretty
concert music. The retort was that Gluck had no gift of
melody, though they admitted he had the advantage over
his rival of making more noise. The poor Italian was so
much distressed by the fierce contest that he and his family
were in despair on the night of the first representation.
He could only say to his weeping wife and son, &ldquo;Come,
my children, this is unreasonable. Remember that we are
not among savages; we are living with the politest and
kindest nation in Europe. If they do not like me as a
musician, they will at all events respect me as a man and a
stranger.&rdquo; To do justice to Piccini, a mild and timid man,
he never took part in the controversy, and always spoke of
his opponent with profound respect and admiration.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Marie Antoinette, whom Mdme. du Barry and her clique
looked on as Piccini&rsquo;s enemy, astonished both cabals by
appointing Piccini her singing-master&mdash;an unprofitable
honour, for he received no pay, and was obliged to give
costly copies of his compositions to the royal family. He
might have quoted from the Latin poet in regard to this
favour from Marie Antoinette, whose faction in music,
among other names, was known as the Greek party, &ldquo;<i>Timeo
Danaos et dona ferentes</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> Beaumarchais, the brilliant
author of &ldquo;Figaro,&rdquo; had found the same inconvenience when
acting as court teacher to the daughters of Louis XV.
The French kings were parsimonious except when lavishing
money on their vices.</p>

<p>The action of the dauphiness, however, paved the way
for a reconciliation between Piccini and Gluck. Berton,
the manager of the opera, gave a luxurious banquet, and
the musicians, side by side, pledged each other in libations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
of champagne. Gluck got confidential in his cups. &ldquo;These
French,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are good enough people, but they make
me laugh. They want us to write songs for them, and they
can&rsquo;t sing.&rdquo; In fact, the quarrel was not between the
musicians but their adherents. In his own heart Piccini
knew his inferiority to Gluck.</p>

<p>De Vismes, Berton&rsquo;s successor, proposed that both should
write operas on the same subject, &ldquo;Iphigenia in Tauris,&rdquo;
and gave him a libretto. &ldquo;The French public will have for
the first time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the pleasure of hearing two operas
on the same theme, with the same incidents, the same
characters, but composed by two great masters of totally
different schools.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; objected the alarmed Italian, &ldquo;if Gluck&rsquo;s opera is
played first, the public will be so delighted that they will
not listen to mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To avoid that catastrophe,&rdquo; said the director, &ldquo;we will
play yours first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Gluck will not permit it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give you my word of honour,&rdquo; said De Vismes, &ldquo;that
your opera shall be put in rehearsal and brought out as
soon as it is finished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Piccini had finished his opera, he heard that his
rival was back from Germany with his &ldquo;Iphigenia&rdquo; completed,
and that it was in rehearsal. The director excused
himself on the plea of its being a royal command. Gluck&rsquo;s
work was his masterpiece, and produced an unparalleled
sensation among the Parisians. Even his enemies were
silenced, and La Harpe said it was the <i>chef-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i> of the
world. Piccini&rsquo;s work, when produced, was admired, but it
stood no chance with the profound, serious, and wonderfully
dramatic composition of his rival.</p>

<p>On the night of the first performance Mdlle. Laguerre, to
whom Piccini had trusted the r&ocirc;le of Iphigenia, could not
stand straight from intoxication. &ldquo;This is not &lsquo;Iphigenia
in Tauris,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the witty Sophie Arnould, &ldquo;but &lsquo;Iphigenia
in champagne.&rsquo;&rdquo; She compensated afterwards, though, by
singing the part with exquisite effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
While the Gluck-Piccini battle was at its height, an
amateur who was disgusted with the contest returned to the
country and sang the praises of the birds and their
gratuitous performances in the following epigram:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;La n&rsquo;est point d&rsquo;art, d&rsquo;ennui scientifique;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Piccini, Gluck, n&rsquo;ont point not&eacute; les airs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature seule en dicta la musique,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et Marmontel n&rsquo;en a pas fait les vers.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The sentiment of this was probably applauded by the
many who were wearied of the bitter recriminations, which
degraded the art which they professed to serve.</p>

<p>During the period when Gluck and Piccini were composing
for the French opera, its affairs nourished liberally
under the sway of De Vismes. Gluck, Piccini, and Rameau
wrote serious operas, while Piccini, Sacchini, Anfossi, and
Paisiello composed comic operas. The ballet flourished
with unsurpassed splendour, and on the whole it may be
said that never has the opera presented more magnificence
at Paris than during the time France was on the eve of the
Reign of Terror. The gay capital was thronged with great
singers, the traditions of whose artistic ability compare
favourably with those of a more recent period.</p>

<p>The witty and beautiful Sophie Arnould, who had a train
of princes at her feet, was the principal exponent of Gluck&rsquo;s
heroines, while Mdlle. Laguerre was the mainstay of the
Piccinists. The rival factions made the names of these
charming and capricious women their war-cries not less
than those of the composers. The public bowed and cringed
before these idols of the stage. Gaetan Vestris, the first of
the family, known as the &ldquo;<i>Dieu de la Danse</i>&rdquo; and who
held that there were only three great men in Europe,
Frederick the Great of Prussia, Voltaire, and himself,
dared to dictate even to Gluck. &ldquo;Write me the music of a
chaconne, Monsieur Gluck,&rdquo; said the god of dancing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A chaconne!&rdquo; said the enraged composer. &ldquo;Do you
think the Greeks, whose manners we are endeavouring to
depict, knew what a chaconne was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did they not?&rdquo; replied Vestris, astonished at this news,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
and in a tone of compassion continued, &ldquo;then they are
much to be pitied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vestris did not obtain his ballet music from the obdurate
German; but, when Piccini&rsquo;s rival &ldquo;<i>Iphig&eacute;nie en Tauride</i>&rdquo;
was produced, such beautiful dance measures were furnished
by the Italian composer as gave Vestris the opportunity for
one of his greatest triumphs.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The contest between Gluck and Piccini, or rather the
cabals who adopted the two musicians as their figure-heads,
was brought to an end by the death of the former. An
attempt was made to set up Sacchini in his place, but it
proved unavailing, as the new composer proved to be quite
as much a follower of the prevailing Italian method as of
the new school of Gluck. The French revolution swept
away Piccini&rsquo;s property, and he retired to Italy. Bad
fortune pursued him, however. Queen Caroline of Naples
conceived a dislike to him, and used her influence to injure
his career, out of a fit of wounded vanity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you not think I resemble my sister, Marie
Antoinette?&rdquo; queried the somewhat ill-favoured queen.
Piccini, embarrassed but truthful, replied, &ldquo;Your majesty,
there may be a family likeness, but no resemblance.&rdquo; A
fatality attended him even to Venice. In 1792 he was
mobbed and his house burned, because the populace
regarded him as a republican, for he had a French son-in-law.
Some partial musical successes, however, consoled
him, though they flattered his <i>amour propre</i> more than
they benefited his purse. On his return to Naples he was
subjected to a species of imprisonment during four years,
for royal displeasure in those days did not confine itself
merely to lack of court favour. Reduced to great poverty,
the composer who had been the favourite of the rich and
great for so many years knew often the actual pangs of
hunger, and eked out his subsistence by writing conventual
psalms, as payment for the broken food doled out
by the monks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
At last he was released, and the tenor, David, sent him
funds to pay his journey to Paris. Napoleon, the first
consul, received him cordially in the Luxembourg palace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said he to Piccini, who remained standing,
&ldquo;a man of your greatness stands in no one&rsquo;s presence.&rdquo;
His reception in Paris was, in fact, an ovation. The
manager of the opera gave him a pension of twenty-four
hundred francs, a government pension was also accorded,
and he was appointed sixth inspector at the Conservatory.
But the benefits of this pale gleam of wintry sunshine did
not long remain. He died at Passy in the year 1800, and
was followed to the grave by a great throng of those who
loved his beautiful music and admired his gentle life.</p>

<p>In the present day Gluck appears to have vanquished
Piccini, because occasionally an opera of the former is performed,
while Piccini&rsquo;s works are only known to the
musical antiquarian. But even the marble temples of
Gluck are moss-grown and neglected, and that great man
is known to the present day rather as one whose influence
profoundly coloured and changed the philosophy of opera,
than through any immediate acquaintance with his productions.
The connoisseurs of the eighteenth century
found Piccini&rsquo;s melodies charming, but the works that
endure as masterpieces are not those which contain the
greatest number of beauties, but those of which the form
is the most perfect. Gluck had larger conceptions and
more powerful genius than his Italian rival, but the latter&rsquo;s
sweet spring of melody gave him the highest place which
had so far been attained in the Italian operatic school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Piccini,&rdquo; says M. Gengu&egrave;n&eacute;, his biographer, &ldquo;was under
the middle size, but well made, with considerable dignity of
carriage. His countenance was very agreeable. His mind
was acute, enlarged, and cultivated. Latin and Italian
literature was familiar to him when he went to France, and
afterwards he became almost as well acquainted with
French literature. He spoke and wrote Italian with great
purity, but among his countrymen he preferred the Neapolitan
dialect, which he considered the most expressive, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
most difficult, and the most figurative of all languages.
He used it principally in narration, with a gaiety, a truth,
and a pantomimic expression after the manner of his country,
which delighted all his friends, and made his stories
intelligible even to those who knew Italian but slightly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a musician Piccini was noticeable, according to the
judgment of his best critics, for the purity and simplicity
of his style. He always wished to preserve the supremacy
of the voice, and, though he well knew how to make his
instrumentation rich and effective, he was a resolute
opponent to the florid and complex accompaniments which
were coming into vogue in his day. His recorded opinion
on this subject may have some interest for the musicians
of the present day:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were the employment which Nature herself assigns to
the instruments of an orchestra preserved to them, a variety
of effects and a series of infinitely diversified pictures would
be produced. But they are all thrown in at once and used
incessantly, and they thus overpower and indurate the ear,
without presenting any picture to the mind, to which the
ear is the passage. I should be glad to know how they will
arouse it when it is accustomed to this uproar, which will
soon happen, and of what new witchcraft they will avail
themselves.... It is well known what occurs to palates
blunted by the use of spirituous liquors. In a few months
everything may be learned which is necessary to produce
these exaggerated effects, but it requires much time and
study to be able to excite genuine emotion.&rdquo; Piccini followed
strictly the canons of the Italian school; and, though
far inferior in really great qualities to his rival Gluck, his
compositions had in them so much of fluent grace and
beauty as to place him at the head of his predecessors.
Some curious critics have indeed gone so far as to charge
that many of the finest arias of Rossini, Donizetti, and
Bellini owe their paternity to this composer, an indictment
not uncommon in music, for most of the great composers
have rifled the sweets of their predecessors without scruple.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span></p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Paisiello and Cimarosa, in their style and processes of
work, seem to have more nearly caught the mantle of
Piccini than any others, though they were contemporaries
as well as successors. <span class="smcap">Giovanni Paisiello</span>, born in 1741,
was educated, like many other great musicians, at the Conservatory
of San Onofrio. During his early life he produced
a great number of pieces for the Italian theatres, and
in 1776 accepted the invitation of Catherine to become the
court composer at St. Petersburg, where he remained
nine years, and produced several of his best operas, chief
among them, &ldquo;Il Barbiere di Seviglia&rdquo; (a different version
of Beaumarchais&rsquo;s celebrated comedy from that afterwards
used by Rossini).</p>

<p>The empress was devotedly attached to him, and showed
her esteem in many signal ways. On one occasion, while
Paisiello was accompanying her in a song, she observed that
he shuddered with the bitter cold. On this Catherine took
off her splendid ermine cloak, decorated with clasps of
brilliants, and threw it over her tutor&rsquo;s shoulders. In a
quarrel which Paisiello had with Marshal Beloseloky, the
temporary favourite of the Russian Messalina, her favour
was shown in a still more striking way. The marshal had
given the musician a blow, on which Paisiello, a very large,
athletic man, drubbed the Russian general most unmercifully.
The latter demanded the immediate dismissal of the
composer for having insulted a dignitary of the empire.
Catherine&rsquo;s reply was similar to the one made by Francis
the First of France in a parallel case about Leonardo da
Vinci&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I neither can nor will attend to your request; you
forgot your dignity when you gave an unoffending man and
a great artist a blow. Are you surprised that he should
have forgotten it too? As for rank, it is in my power to
make fifty marshals, but not one Paisiello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some years after his return to Italy, he was engaged by
Napoleon as chapel-master; for that despot ruled the art
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
and literature of his times as autocratically as their politics.
Though Paisiello did not wish to obey the mandate, to
refuse was ruin. The French ruler had already shown his
favour by giving him the preference over Cherubini in
several important musical contests, for the latter had
always displayed stern independence of courtly favour. On
Paisiello&rsquo;s arrival in Paris, several lucrative appointments
indicated the sincerity of Napoleon&rsquo;s intentions. The
composer did not hesitate to stand on his rights as a
musician on all occasions. When Napoleon complained of
the inefficiency of the chapel service, he said, courageously,
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t blame people for doing their duty carelessly, when
they are not justly paid.&rdquo; The cunning Italian knew how
to flatter, though, when occasion served. He once addressed
his master as &ldquo;Sire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sire,&rsquo; what do you mean?&rdquo; answered the first consul.
&ldquo;I am a general and nothing more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, General,&rdquo; continued the composer, &ldquo;I have come
to place myself at your majesty&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must really beg you,&rdquo; rejoined Napoleon, &ldquo;not to
address me in this manner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, General,&rdquo; said Paisiello. &ldquo;But I cannot
give up the habit I have contracted in addressing sovereigns,
who, compared with you, are but pigmies. However, I will
not forget your commands, and, if I have been unfortunate
enough to offend, I must throw myself on your majesty&rsquo;s
indulgence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paisiello received ten thousand francs for the mass
written for Napoleon&rsquo;s coronation, and one thousand for all
others. As he produced masses with great rapidity, he
could very well afford to neglect operatic writing during
this period. His masses were pasticcio work made up of
pieces selected from his operas and other compositions.
This could be easily done, for music is arbitrary in its
associations. Love songs of a passionate and sentimental
cast were quickly made religious by suitable words. Thus
the same melody will depict equally well the rage of a
baffled conspirator, the jealousy of an injured husband, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
grief of lovers about to part, the despondency of a man bent
on suicide, the devotion of the nun, or the rapt adoration of
worship. A different text and a slight change in time
effect the marvel, and hardly a composer has disdained to
borrow from one work to enrich another. His only opera
composed in Paris, &ldquo;Proserpine,&rdquo; was not successful.</p>

<p>Failure of health obliged Paisiello to return to Naples,
when he again entered the service of the king. Attached
to the fortunes of the Bonaparte family, his prosperity fell
with theirs. He had been crowned with honours by all the
musical societies of the world, but his pensions and emoluments
ceased with the fall of Joachim Murat from the
Neapolitan throne. He died June 5, 1816, and the court,
which neglected him living, gave him a magnificent funeral.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paisiello,&rdquo; says the Chevalier Le Sueur, &ldquo;was not only
a great musician, but possessed a large fund of general
information. He was well versed in the dead languages,
acquainted with all branches of literature, and on terms of
friendship with the most distinguished persons of the age.
His mind was noble and above all mean passions; he
neither knew envy nor the feeling of rivalry.... He
composed,&rdquo; says the same writer, &ldquo;seventy-eight operas, of
which twenty-seven were serious, and fifty-one comic, eight
<i>intermezzi</i>, and an immense number of cantatas, oratorios,
masses, etc.; seven symphonies for King Joseph of Spain,
and many miscellaneous pieces for the court of Russia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paisiello&rsquo;s style, according to F&eacute;tis, was characterised by
great simplicity and apparent facility. His few and
unadorned notes, full of grace, were yet deep and varied in
their expression. In his simplicity was the proof of his
abundance. It was not necessary for him to have recourse
to musical artifice and complication to conceal poverty of
invention. His accompaniments were similar in character,
clear and picturesque, without pretence of elaboration.
The latter not only relieved and sustained the voice, but
were full of original effects, novel to his time. He was
the author, too, of important improvements in instrumental
composition. He introduced the viola, clarionet, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
bassoon into the orchestra of the Italian opera. Though
voluminous both in serious and comic opera, it was in the
latter that he won his chief laurels. His &ldquo;Pazza per
Amore&rdquo; was one of the great Pasta&rsquo;s favourites, and
Catalani added largely to her reputation in the part of
<i>La Frascatana</i>. Several of Paisiello&rsquo;s comic operas still
keep a dramatic place on the German stage, where
excellence is not sacrificed to novelty.</p>

<p>A still higher place must be assigned to another disciple
and follower of the school perfected by Piccini, <span class="smcap">Dominic
Cimarosa</span>, born in Naples in 1749. His life down to his
latter years was an uninterrupted flow of prosperity. His
mother, a humble washerwoman, could do little for her
fatherless child, but an observant priest saw the promise of
the lad, and taught him till he was old enough to enter the
Conservatory of St. Maria di Loretto. His early works
showed brilliant invention and imagination, and the young
Cimarosa, before he left the Conservatory, had made himself
a good violinist and singer. He worked hard, during a
musical apprenticeship of many years, to lay a solid foundation
for the fame which his teachers prophesied for him
from the onset. Like Paisiello, he was for several years
attached to the court of Catherine II. of Russia. He had
already produced a number of pleasing works, both serious
and comic, for the Italian theatres, and his faculty of production
was equalled by the richness and variety of his
scores. During a period of four years spent at the imperial
court of the North, Cimarosa produced nearly five hundred
works, great and small, and only left the service of his
magnificent patroness, who was no less passionately fond of
art than she was great as a ruler and dissolute as a woman,
because the severe climate affected his health, for he was a
typical Italian in his temperament.</p>

<p>He was arrested in his southward journey by the urgent
persuasions of the Emperor Leopold, who made him chapel-master,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
with a salary of twelve thousand florins. The taste
for the Italian school was still paramount at the musical
capital of Austria. Though such composers as Haydn,
Salieri, and young Mozart, who had commenced to be welcomed
as an unexampled prodigy, were in Vienna, the
court preferred the suave and shallow beauties of Italian
music to their own serious German school, which was
commencing to send down such deep roots into the popular
heart.</p>

<p>Cimarosa produced &ldquo;Il Matrimonio Segreto&rdquo; (The Secret
Marriage), his finest opera, for his new patron. The libretto
was founded on a forgotten French operetta, which again
was adapted from Garrick and Colman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Clandestine
Marriage.&rdquo; The emperor could not attend the first representation,
but a brilliant audience hailed it with delight.
Leopold made amends, though, on the second night, for he
stood in his box, and said, aloud&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bravo, Cimarosa, bravissimo! The whole opera is
admirable, delightful, enchanting! I did not applaud, that
I might not lose a single note of this masterpiece. You
have heard it twice, and I must have the same pleasure
before I go to bed. Singers and musicians, pass into the
next room. Cimarosa will come, too, and preside at the
banquet prepared for you. When you have had sufficient
rest, we will begin again. I encore the whole opera, and
in the meanwhile let us applaud it as it deserves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The emperor gave the signal, and, midst a thunderstorm
of plaudits, the musicians passed into their midnight feast.
There is no record of any other such compliment, except
that to the Latin dramatist, Plautus, whose &ldquo;Eunuchus&rdquo;
was performed twice on the same day.</p>

<p>Yet the same Viennese public, six years before, had
actually hissed Mozart&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nozze di Figaro,&rdquo; which shares
with Rossini&rsquo;s &ldquo;Il Barbiere&rdquo; the greatest rank in comic
opera, and has retained, to this day, its perennial freshness
and interest. Cimarosa himself did not share the opinion
of his admirers in respect to Mozart. A certain Viennese
painter attempted to flatter him, by decrying Mozart&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
music in comparison with his own. The following retort
shows the nobility of genius&mdash;&ldquo;I, sir? What would you
call the man who would seek to assure you that you were
superior to Raphael?&rdquo; Another acute rejoinder, on the
respective merits of Mozart and Cimarosa, was made by the
French composer, Gr&eacute;try, in answer to a criticism by
Napoleon, when first consul, that great man affecting to be
a <i>dilettante</i> in music&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sire, Cimarosa puts the statue on the theatre and the
pedestal in the orchestra, instead of which Mozart puts the
statue in the orchestra and the pedestal on the theatre.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The composer&rsquo;s hitherto brilliant career was doomed to a
gloomy close. On returning to Naples, at the Emperor
Leopold&rsquo;s death, Cimarosa produced several of his finest
works; among which musical students place first&mdash;&ldquo;Il
Matrimonio per Susurro,&rdquo; &ldquo;La Penelope,&rdquo; &ldquo;L&rsquo;Olimpiade,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Il Sacrificio d&rsquo;Abrama,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gli Amanti Comici,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gli
Orazi.&rdquo; These were performed almost simultaneously in
the theatres of Paris, Naples, and Vienna. Cimarosa
attached himself warmly to the French cause in Italy, and
when the Bourbons finally triumphed the musician suffered
their bitterest resentment. He narrowly escaped with his
life, and languished for a long time in a dungeon, so closely
immured that it was for a long time believed by his friends
that his head had fallen on the block.</p>

<p>At length released, he quitted the Neapolitan territory,
only to die at Venice in a few months, &ldquo;in consequence,&rdquo;
Stendhall says, in his <i>Life of Rossini</i>, &ldquo;of the barbarous
treatment he had met with in the prison into which he
had been thrown by Queen Caroline.&rdquo; He died January
11, 1801.</p>

<p>Cimarosa&rsquo;s genius embraced both the tragic and comic
schools of composition. He may be specially called a
genuine master of musical comedy. He was the finest
example of the school perfected by Piccini, and was indeed
the link between the old Italian opera and the new development
of which Rossini is such a brilliant exponent.
Schl&uuml;ter, in his <i>History of Music</i>, says of him&mdash;&ldquo;Like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
Mozart, he excels in those parts of an opera which decide
its merits as a work of art, the <i>ensembles</i> and <i>finale</i>. His
admirable and by no means antiquated opera, &lsquo;Il Matrimonio
Segreto&rsquo; (the charming offspring of his &lsquo;secret marriage&rsquo;
with the Mozart opera) is a model of exquisite and
graceful comedy. The overture bears a striking resemblance
to that of &lsquo;Figaro,&rsquo; and the instrumentation of the whole
opera is highly characteristic, though not so prominent as
in Mozart. Especially delightful are the secret love-scenes,
written evidently <i>con amore</i>, the composer having practised
them many a time in his youth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This opera is still performed in many parts of Europe to
delighted audiences, and is ranked by competent critics as
the third finest comic opera extant, Mozart and Rossini
only surpassing him in their masterpieces. It was a great
favourite with Lablache, and its magnificent performance
by Grisi, Mario, Tamburini, and the king of bassos, is a
gala reminiscence of English and French opera-goers.</p>

<p>We quote an opinion also from another able authority&mdash;&ldquo;The
drama of &lsquo;Gli Orazi&rsquo; is taken from Corneille&rsquo;s tragedy,
&lsquo;Les Horaces.&rsquo; The music is full of noble simplicity,
beautiful melody, and strong expression. In the airs dramatic
truth is never sacrificed to vocal display, and the
concerted pieces are grand, broad, and effective. Taken as
a whole, the piece is free from antiquated and obsolete
forms; and it wants nothing but an orchestral score of
greater fullness and variety to satisfy the modern ear. It
is still frequently performed in Germany, though in France
and England, and even in its native country, it seems to be
forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cardinal Consalvi, Cimarosa&rsquo;s friend, caused splendid
funeral honours to be paid to him at Rome. Canova
executed a marble bust of him, which was placed in the
gallery of the Capitol.</p>

<h2><a name="rossini" id="rossini"></a><i>ROSSINI.</i></h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> &ldquo;Swan of Pesaro&rdquo; is a name linked with some of
the most charming musical associations of this age. Though
forty years silence made fruitless what should have been the
richest creative period of Rossini&rsquo;s life, his great works,
poured forth with such facility, and still retaining their
grasp in spite of all changes in public opinion, stamp him
as being the most gifted composer ever produced by a
country so fecund in musical geniuses. The old set forms
of Italian opera had already yielded in large degree to the
energy and pomp of French declamation, when Rossini
poured into them afresh such exhilaration and sparkle as
again placed his country in the van of musical Europe.
With no pretension to the grand, majestic, and severe, his
fresh and delightful melodies, flowing without stint,
excited alike the critical and the unlearned into a species
of artistic craze, a mania which has not yet subsided.
The stiff and stately Oublicheff confesses, with many compunctions
of conscience, that, when listening for the first
time to one of Rossini&rsquo;s operas, he forgot for the time
being all that he had ever known, admired, played, or sung,
for he was musically drunk, as if with champagne. Learned
Germans might shake their heads and talk about shallowness
and contrapuntal rubbish, his <i>crescendo</i> and <i>stretto</i>
passages, his tameness and uniformity even in melody,
his want of artistic finish; but, as Richard Wagner, his
direct antipodes, frankly confesses in his &ldquo;Oper und
Drama,&rdquo; such objections were dispelled by Rossini&rsquo;s opera-airs
as if they were mere delusions of the fancy. Essentially
different from Beethoven, Bach, Mozart, Haydn, or even
Weber, with whom he has some affinities, he stands a
unique figure in the history of art, an original both as man
and musician.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Gioacchino Rossini</span> was the son of a town-trumpeter
and an operatic singer of inferior rank, born in Pesaro,
Romagna, February 29, 1792. The child attended the
itinerant couple in their visits to fairs and musical gatherings,
and was in danger, at the age of seven, of becoming a
thorough-paced little vagabond, when maternal alarm trusted
his education to the friendly hands of the music-master,
Prinetti. At this tender age even he had been introduced to
the world of art, for he sang the part of a child at the
Bologna opera. &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Mdme. Georgi-Righetti,
&ldquo;could be imagined more tender, more touching, than the
voice and action of this remarkable child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young Rossini, after a year or two, came under the
notice of the celebrated teacher Tesei, of Bologna, who gave
him lessons in pianoforte playing and the voice, and
obtained him a good place as boy-soprano at one of the
churches. He now attracted the attention of the Countess
Perticari, who admired his voice, and she sent him to the
Lyceum to learn fugue and counterpoint at the feet of a
very strict Gamaliel, Padre Mattei. The youth was no dull
student, and, in spite of his capricious indolence, which
vexed the soul of his tutor, he made such rapid progress
that at the age of sixteen he was chosen to write the
cantata, annually awarded to the most promising student.
Success greeted the juvenile effort, and thus we see Rossini
fairly launched as a composer. Of the early operas which
he poured out for five years it is not needful to speak,
except that one of them so pleased the austere Marshal
Massena that he exempted the composer from conscription.
The first opera which made Rossini&rsquo;s name famous through
Europe was &ldquo;Tancredi,&rdquo; written for the Venetian public.
To this opera belongs the charming &ldquo;Di tanti palpiti,&rdquo;
written under the following circumstances:&mdash;Mdme.
Melanotte, the <i>prima donna</i>, took the whim during the final
rehearsal that she would not sing the opening air, but must
have another. Rossini went home in sore disgust, for the
whole opera was likely to be put off by this caprice. There
were but two hours before the performance. He sat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
waiting for his macaroni, when an exquisite air came into
his head, and it was written in five minutes.</p>

<p>After his great success he received offers from almost
every town in Italy, each clamouring to be served first.
Every manager was required to furnish his theatre with an
opera from the pen of the new idol. For these earlier
essays he received a thousand francs each, and he wrote five
or six a year. Stendhall, Rossini&rsquo;s spirited biographer, gives
a picturesque account of life in the Italian theatres at this
time, a status which remains in some of its features to-day&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mechanism is as follows:&mdash;The manager is frequently
one of the most wealthy and considerable persons
of the little town he inhabits. He forms a company,
consisting of <i>prima donna</i>, <i>tenoro</i>, <i>basso cantante</i>, <i>basso buffo</i>,
a second female singer, and a third <i>basso</i>. The <i>libretto</i>, or
poem, is purchased for sixty or eighty francs from some
unlucky son of the muses, who is generally a half-starved
abb&eacute;, the hanger-on of some rich family in the neighbourhood.
The character of the parasite, so admirably painted
by Terence, is still to be found in all its glory in Lombardy,
where the smallest town can boast of some five or six families
of some wealth. A <i>maestro</i>, or composer, is then engaged
to write a new opera, and he is obliged to adapt his own
airs to the voices and capacity of the company. The
manager intrusts the care of the financial department to a
<i>registrario</i>, who is generally some pettifogging attorney, who
holds the position of his steward. The next thing that
generally happens is that the manager falls in love with the
<i>prima donna</i>; and the progress of this important amour
gives ample employment to the curiosity of the gossips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The company thus organised at length gives its first
representation, after a month of cabals and intrigues, which
furnish conversation for the town. This is an event in the
simple annals of the town, of the importance of which the
residents of large places can form no idea. During months
together a population of eight or ten thousand people do
nothing but discuss the merit of the forthcoming music and
singers with the eager impetuosity which belongs to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
Italian character and climate. The first representation, if
successful, is generally followed by twenty or thirty more of
the same piece, after which the company breaks up....
From this little sketch of theatrical arrangements in Italy
some idea may be formed of the life which Rossini led
from 1810 to 1816.&rdquo; Between these years he visited all the
principal towns, remaining three or four months at each, the
idolised guest of the <i>dilettanti</i> of the place. Rossini&rsquo;s idleness
and love of good cheer always made him procrastinate
his labours till the last moment, and placed him in dilemmas
from which only his fluency of composition extricated him.
His biographer says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The day of performance is fast approaching, and yet he
cannot resist the pressing invitations of these friends to dine
with them at the tavern. This, of course, leads to a supper,
the champagne circulates freely, and the hour of morning
steals on apace. At length a compunctious vision shoots
across the mind of the truant composer. He rises abruptly;
his friends insist on seeing him home; and they parade the
silent streets bareheaded, shouting in chorus whatever comes
uppermost, perhaps a portion of a <i>miserere</i>, to the great
scandal of pious Catholics tucked snugly in their beds. At
length he reaches his lodging, and shutting himself up in his
chamber is, at this, to every-day mortals, most ungenial hour,
visited by some of his most brilliant inspirations. These he
hastily scratches down on scraps of paper, and next morning
arranges them, or, in his own phrase, instruments them,
amid the renewed interruptions of his visitors. At length
the important night arrives. The <i>maestro</i> takes his place at
the pianoforte. The theatre is overflowing, people having
flocked to the town from ten leagues distance. Every inn
is crowded, and those unable to get other accommodations
encamp around the theatre in their various vehicles. All
business is suspended, and, during the performances, the
town has the appearance of a desert. The passions, the
anxieties, the very life of a whole population are centered in
the theatre.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rossini would preside at the first three representations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
and, after receiving a grand civic banquet, set out for the
next place, his portmanteau fuller of music-paper than of
other effects, and perhaps a dozen sequins in his pocket.
His love of jesting during these gay Bohemian wanderings
made him perpetrate innumerable practical jokes, not sparing
himself when he had no more available food for mirth. On
one occasion, in travelling from Ancona to Reggio, he
passed himself off for a musical professor, a mortal enemy of
Rossini, and sang the words of his own operas to the most
execrable music, in a cracked voice, to show his superiority
to that donkey, Rossini. An unknown admirer of his was
in such a rage that he was on the point of chastising him
for slandering the great musician, about whom Italy raved.</p>

<p>Our composer&rsquo;s earlier style was quite simple and unadorned,
a fact difficult for the present generation, only
acquainted with the florid beauties of his later works, to
appreciate. Rossini only followed the traditions of Italian
music in giving singers full opportunity to embroider the
naked score at their own pleasure. He was led to change
this practice by the following incident. The tenor-singer
Velluti was then the favourite of the Italian theatres, and
indulged in the most unwarrantable tricks with his composers.
During the first performance of &ldquo;L&rsquo;Aureliano,&rdquo; at
Naples, the singer loaded the music with such ornaments
that Rossini could not recognise the offspring of his own
brains. A fierce quarrel ensued between the two, and the
composer determined thereafter to write music of such a
character that the most stupid singer could not suppose any
adornment needed. From that time the Rossini music was
marked by its florid and brilliant embroidery. Of the same
Velluti, spoken of above, an incident is told, illustrating the
musical craze of the country and the period. A Milanese
gentleman, whose father was very ill, met his friend in the
street&mdash;&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; &ldquo;To the Scala, to be
sure.&rdquo; &ldquo;How! your father lies at the point of death.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes! yes! I know, but Velluti sings to-night.&rdquo;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span></p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>An important step in Rossini&rsquo;s early career was his connection
with the widely known impresario of the San Carlo,
Naples, Barbaja. He was under contract to produce two
new operas annually, to rearrange all old scores, and to
conduct at all of the theatres ruled by this manager. He
was to receive two hundred ducats a month, and a share in
the profits of the bank of the San Carlo gambling-saloon.
His first opera composed here was &ldquo;Elisabetta, Regina
d&rsquo;Inghilterra,&rdquo; which was received with a genuine Neapolitan
<i>furore</i>. Rossini was f&ecirc;ted and caressed by the ardent <i>dilettanti</i>
of this city to his heart&rsquo;s content, and was such an idol of the
&ldquo;fickle fair&rdquo; that his career on more than one occasion
narrowly escaped an untimely close, from the prejudices of
jealous spouses. The composer was very vain of his handsome
person, and boasted of his <i>escapades d&rsquo;amour</i>. Many,
too, will recall his <i>mot</i>, spoken to a beauty standing between
himself and the Duke of Wellington&mdash;&ldquo;Madame, how
happy should you be to find yourself placed between the
two greatest men in Europe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of Rossini&rsquo;s adventures at Naples has in it something
of romance. He was sitting in his chamber, humming one
of his own operatic airs, when the ugliest Mercury he had
ever seen entered and gave him a note, then instantly withdrew.
This, of course, was a tender invitation, and
an assignation at a romantic spot in the suburb. On arriving
Rossini sang his <i>aria</i> for a signal, and from the gate of a
charming park surrounding a small villa appeared his beautiful
and unknown inamorata. On parting it was agreed that
the same messenger should bring notice of the second
appointment. Rossini suspected that the lady, in disguise,
was her own envoy, and verified the guess by following the
light-footed page. He then discovered that she was the wife
of a wealthy Sicilian, widely noted for her beauty, and one of
the reigning toasts. On renewing his visit, he barely arrived at
the gate of the park, when a carbine-bullet grazed his head,
and two masked assailants sprang toward him with drawn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
rapiers, a proceeding which left Rossini no option but to
take to his heels, as he was unarmed.</p>

<p>During the composer&rsquo;s residence at Naples he was made
acquainted with many of the most powerful princes and
nobles of Europe, and his name became a recognised factor
in European music, though his works were not widely
known outside of his native land. His reputation for
genius spread by report, for all who came in contact with
the brilliant, handsome Rossini were charmed. That which
placed his European fame on a solid basis was the production
of &ldquo;Il Barbiere di Seviglia&rdquo; at Rome during the
carnival season of 1816.</p>

<p>Years before Rossini had thought of setting the sparkling
comedy of Beaumarchais to music, and Sterbini, the author
of the <i>libretto</i> used by Paisiello, had proposed to rearrange
the story. Rossini, indeed, had been so complaisant as to
write to the older composer for permission to set fresh
music to the comedy; a concession not needed, for the
plays of Metastasio had been used by different musicians
without scruple. Paisiello intrigued against the new
opera, and organised a conspiracy to kill it on the first
night. Sterbini made the libretto totally different from the
other, and Rossini finished the music in thirteen days,
during which he never left the house. &ldquo;Not even did I
get shaved,&rdquo; he said to a friend. &ldquo;It seems strange that
through the &lsquo;Barber&rsquo; you should have gone without shaving.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If I had shaved,&rdquo; Rossini exclaimed, &ldquo;I should
have gone out; and, if I had gone out, I should not have
come back in time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first performance was a curious scene. The Argentina
Theatre was packed with friends and foes. One of the
greatest of tenors, Garcia, the father of Malibran and Pauline
Viardot, sang Almaviva. Rossini had been weak enough
to allow Garcia to sing a Spanish melody for a serenade,
for the latter urged the necessity of vivid national and local
colour. The tenor had forgotten to tune his guitar, and in
the operation on the stage a string broke. This gave the
signal for a tumult of ironical laughter and hisses. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
same hostile atmosphere continued during the evening.
Even Madame Georgi-Righetti, a great favourite of the
Romans, was coldly received by the audience. In short,
the opera seemed likely to be damned.</p>

<p>When the singers went to condole with Rossini, they
found him enjoying a luxurious supper with the gusto of the
<i>gourmet</i> that he was. Settled in his knowledge that he had
written a masterpiece, he could not be disturbed by unjust
clamour. The next night the fickle Romans made ample
amends, for the opera was concluded amid the warmest
applause, even from the friends of Paisiello.</p>

<p>Rossini&rsquo;s &ldquo;Il Barbiere,&rdquo; within six months, was performed
on nearly every stage in Europe, and received universally
with great admiration. It was only in Paris, two years
afterwards, that there was some coldness in its reception.
Every one said that after Paisiello&rsquo;s music on the same
subject it was nothing, when it was suggested that Paisiello&rsquo;s
should be revived. So the St. Petersburg &ldquo;Barbiere&rdquo; of
1788 was produced, and beside Rossini&rsquo;s it proved so dull,
stupid, and antiquated that the public instantly recognised
the beauties of the work which they had persuaded themselves
to ignore. Yet for this work, which placed the
reputation of the young composer on a lofty pedestal, he
received only two thousand francs.</p>

<p>Our composer took his failures with great phlegm and
good-nature, based, perhaps, on an invincible self-confidence.
When his &ldquo;Sigismonde&rdquo; had been hissed at
Venice, he sent his mother a <i>fiasco</i> (bottle). In the last
instance he sent her, on the morning succeeding the first
performance, a letter with a picture of a <i>fiaschetto</i> (little
bottle).</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The same year (1816) was produced at Naples the opera
of &ldquo;Otello,&rdquo; which was an important point of departure in
the reforms introduced by Rossini on the Italian stage.
Before speaking further of this composer&rsquo;s career, it is
necessary to admit that every valuable change furthered by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
him had already been inaugurated by Mozart, a musical
genius so great that he seems to have included all that went
before, all that succeeded him. It was not merely that
Rossini enriched the orchestration to such a degree, but,
revolting from the delay of the dramatic movement, caused
by the great number of arias written for each character, he
gave large prominence to the concerted pieces, and used
them where monologue had formerly been the rule. He
developed the basso and baritone parts, giving them marked
importance in serious opera, and worked out the choruses
and finales with the most elaborate finish.</p>

<p>Lord Mount-Edgcumbe, a celebrated connoisseur and
admirer of the old school, wrote of these innovations,
ignoring the fact that Mozart had given the weight of his
great authority to them before the daring young Italian
composer:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The construction of these newly-invented pieces is
essentially different from the old. The dialogue, which
used to be carried on in recitative, and which, in
Metastasio&rsquo;s operas, is often so beautiful and interesting,
is now cut up (and rendered unintelligible if it were
worth listening to) into <i>pezzi concertati</i>, or long singing
conversations, which present a tedious succession of unconnected,
ever-changing motives, having nothing to do with
each other; and if a satisfactory air is for a moment introduced,
which the ear would like to dwell upon, to hear
modulated, varied, and again returned to, it is broken off,
before it is well understood, by a sudden transition in an
entirely different melody, time, and key, and recurs no
more, so that no impression can be made, or recollection of
it preserved. Single songs are almost exploded.... Even
the <i>prima donna</i>, who formerly would have complained at
having less than three or four airs allotted to her, is now
satisfied with having one single <i>cavatina</i> given to her during
the whole opera.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In &ldquo;Otello,&rdquo; Rossini introduced his operatic changes to
the Italian public, and they were well received; yet great
opposition was manifested by those who clung to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
time-honoured canons. Sigismondi, of the Naples Conservatory,
was horror-stricken on first seeing the score of this opera.
The clarionets were too much for him, but on seeing third
and fourth horn-parts, he exclaimed, &ldquo;What does the man
want? The greatest of our composers have always been
contented with two. Shades of Pergolesi, of Leo, of
Jomelli! How they must shudder at the bare thought!
Four horns! Are we at a hunting-party? Four horns!
Enough to blow us to perdition!&rdquo; Donizetti, who was
Sigismondi&rsquo;s pupil, also tells an amusing incident of his
preceptor&rsquo;s disgust. He was turning over a score of
&ldquo;Semiramide&rdquo; in the library, when the <i>maestro</i> came in
and asked him what music it was. &ldquo;Rossini&rsquo;s,&rdquo; was the
answer. Sigismondi glanced at the page and saw 1. 2. 3.
trumpets, being the first, second, and third trumpet parts.
Aghast, he shouted, stuffing his fingers in his ears, &ldquo;One
hundred and twenty-three trumpets! <em>Corpo di Cristo!</em> the
world&rsquo;s gone mad, and I shall go mad too!&rdquo; And so he
rushed from the room, muttering to himself about the
hundred and twenty-three trumpets.</p>

<p>The Italian public, in spite of such criticism, very soon
accepted the opera of &ldquo;Otello&rdquo; as the greatest serious opera
ever written for their stage. It owed much, however, to the
singers who illustrated its r&ocirc;les. Mdme. Colbran, afterwards
Rossini&rsquo;s wife, sang Desdemona, and David, Otello. The
latter was the predecessor of Rubini as the finest singer of
the Rossinian music. He had the prodigious compass of
three octaves; and M. Bertin, a French critic, says of this
singer, so honourably linked with the career of our composer,
&ldquo;He is full of warmth, <i>verve</i>, energy, expression, and
musical sentiment; alone he can fill up and give life to a
scene; it is impossible for another singer to carry away an
audience as he does, and, when he will only be simple, he
is admirable. He is the Rossini of song; he is the
greatest singer I ever heard.&rdquo; Lord Byron, in one of his
letters to Moore, speaks of the first production at Milan,
and praises the music enthusiastically, while condemning
the libretto as a degradation of Shakespeare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
&ldquo;La Cenerentola&rdquo; and &ldquo;La Gazza Ladra&rdquo; were written
in quick succession for Naples and Milan. The former of
these works, based on the old Cinderella myth, was the last
opera written by Rossini to illustrate the beauties of the
contralto voice, and Madame Georgi-Righetti, the early
friend and steadfast patroness of the musician during his
early days of struggle, made her last great appearance in it
before retiring from the stage. In this composition,
Rossini, though one of the most affluent and rapid of
composers, displays that economy in art which sometimes
characterised him. He introduced in it many of the more
beautiful airs from his earlier and less successful works.
He believed on principle that it was folly to let a good
piece of music be lost through being married to a weak and
faulty libretto. The brilliant opera of &ldquo;La Gazza Ladra,&rdquo;
set to the story of a French melodrama, &ldquo;La Pie Voleuse,&rdquo;
aggravated the quarrel between Paer, the director of the
French opera, and the gifted Italian. Paer had designed to
have written the music himself, but his librettist slyly turned
over the poem to Rossini, who produced one of his masterpieces
in setting it. The audience at La Scala received the
work with the noisiest demonstrations, interrupting the
progress of the drama with constant cries of &ldquo;<em>Bravo!
Maestro!</em>&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>Viva Rossini!</em>&rdquo; The composer afterwards
said that acknowledging the calls of the audience fatigued
him much more than the direction of the opera. When
the same work was produced four years after in London,
under Mr. Ebers&rsquo;s management, an incident related by
that <i>impresario</i> in his <i>Seven Years of the King&rsquo;s Theatre</i>,
shows how eagerly it was received by an English audience:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I entered the stage door, I met an intimate
friend, with a long face and uplifted eyes. &lsquo;Good God! Ebers,
I pity you from my soul. This ungrateful public,&rsquo; he continued.
&lsquo;The wretches! Why! my dear sir, they have not
left you a seat in your own house.&rsquo; Relieved from the fears he
had created, I joined him in his laughter, and proceeded,
assuring him that I felt no ill towards the public for their
conduct towards me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
Passing over &ldquo;Armida,&rdquo; written for the opening of the
new San Carlo at Naples, &ldquo;Adelaida di Borgogna,&rdquo; for the
Roman Carnival of 1817, and &ldquo;Adina,&rdquo; for a Lisbon
theatre, we come to a work which is one of Rossini&rsquo;s most
solid claims on musical immortality, &ldquo;Mos&eacute; in Egitto,&rdquo;
first produced at the San Carlo, Naples, in 1818. In
&ldquo;Mos&eacute;,&rdquo; Rossini carried out still further than ever his
innovations, the two principal r&ocirc;les&mdash;<i>Mos&eacute;</i> and <i>Faraoni</i>&mdash;being
assigned to basses. On the first representation, the
crossing of the Red Sea moved the audience to satirical
laughter, which disconcerted the otherwise favourable
reception of the piece, and entirely spoiled the final effects.
The manager was at his wit&rsquo;s end, till Tottola, the librettist,
suggested a prayer for the Israelites before and after the
passage of the host through the cleft waters. Rossini
instantly seized the idea, and, springing from bed in his
night-shirt, wrote the music with almost inconceivable
rapidity, before his embarrassed visitors recovered from
their surprise. The same evening the magnificent <i>Dal
tuo stellato soglio</i> (&ldquo;To thee, Great Lord&rdquo;) was performed
with the opera.</p>

<p>Let Stendhall, Rossini&rsquo;s biographer, tell the rest of the
story&mdash;&ldquo;The audience was delighted as usual with the first
act, and all went well till the third, when, the passage of the
Red Sea being at hand, the audience as usual prepared
to be amused. The laughter was just beginning in the pit,
when it was observed that Moses was about to sing. He
began his solo, the first verse of a prayer, which all the
people repeat in chorus after Moses. Surprised at this
novelty, the pit listened and the laughter entirely ceased.
The chorus, exceedingly fine, was in the minor. Aaron
continues, followed by the people. Finally, Eleia addresses
to Heaven the same supplication, and the people respond.
Then all fall on their knees and repeat the prayer with
enthusiasm; the miracle is performed, the sea is opened to
leave a path for the people protected by the Lord. This
last part is in the major. It is impossible to imagine the
thunders of applause that resounded through the house;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
one would have thought it was coming down. The
spectators in the boxes, standing up and leaning over, called
out at the top of their voices, &lsquo;<em>Bello, bello! O che bello!</em>&rsquo; I
never saw so much enthusiasm nor such a complete success,
which was so much the greater, inasmuch as the people
were quite prepared to laugh.... I am almost in tears
when I think of this prayer. This state of things lasted
a long time, and one of its effects was to make for its
composer the reputation of an assassin, for Dr. Cottogna is
said to have remarked&mdash;&lsquo;I can cite to you more than forty
attacks of nervous fever or violent convulsions on the part
of young women, fond to excess of music, which have no
other origin than the prayer of the Hebrews in the third
act, with its superb change of key.&rsquo;&rdquo; Thus, by a stroke of
genius, a scene which first impressed the audience as a
piece of theatrical burlesque, was raised to sublimity by the
solemn music written for it.</p>

<p>M. Bochsa some years afterwards produced &ldquo;Mos&eacute;&rdquo; as
an oratorio in London, and it failed. A new libretto,
however, &ldquo;Pietro L&rsquo;Eremito,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> again transformed the
music into an opera. Ebers tells us that Lord Sefton,
a distinguished connoisseur, only pronounced the general
verdict in calling it the greatest of serious operas, for it was
received with the greatest favour. A gentleman of high
rank was not satisfied with assuring the manager that
he had deserved well of his country, but avowed his
determination to propose him for membership at the most
exclusive of aristocratic clubs&mdash;White&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;La Donna del Lago,&rdquo; Rossini&rsquo;s next great work, also
first produced at the San Carlo during the Carnival of 1820,
though splendidly performed, did not succeed well the first
night. The composer left Naples the same night for Milan,
and coolly informed every one <i>en route</i> that the opera was
very successful, which proved to be true when he reached
his journey&rsquo;s end, for the Neapolitans on the second night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
reversed their decision into an enthusiasm as marked as
their coldness had been.</p>

<p>Shortly after this Rossini married his favourite <i>prima
donna</i>, Madame Colbran. He had just completed two of
his now forgotten operas, &ldquo;Bianca e Faliero&rdquo; and &ldquo;Matilda
di Shabran,&rdquo; but did not stay to watch their public reception.
He quietly took away the beautiful Colbran, and at
Bologna was married by the archbishop. Thence the
freshly-wedded couple visited Vienna, and Rossini there
produced his &ldquo;Zelmira,&rdquo; his wife singing the principal part.
One of the most striking of this composer&rsquo;s works in invention
and ingenious development of ideas, Carpani says of
it&mdash;&ldquo;It contains enough to furnish not one but four operas.
In this work, Rossini, by the new riches which he draws
from his prodigious imagination, is no longer the author of
&lsquo;Otello,&rsquo; &lsquo;Tancredi,&rsquo; &lsquo;Zoraide,&rsquo; and all his preceding works;
he is another composer, new, agreeable, and fertile, as
much as at first, but with more command of himself, more
pure, more masterly, and, above all, more faithful to the
interpretation of the words. The forms of style employed
in this opera, according to circumstances, are so varied,
that now we seem to hear Gluck, now Traetta, now Sacchini,
now Mozart, now Handel; for the gravity, the learning,
the naturalness, the suavity of their conceptions, live
and blossom again in &lsquo;Zelmira.&rsquo; The transitions are
learned, and inspired more by considerations of poetry and
sense than by caprice and a mania for innovation. The
vocal parts, always natural, never trivial, give expression to
the words without ceasing to be melodious. The great
point is to preserve both. The instrumentation of Rossini
is really incomparable by the vivacity and freedom of the
manner, by the variety and justness of the colouring.&rdquo;
Yet it must be conceded that, while this opera made a deep
impression on musicians and critics, it did not please the
general public. It proved languid and heavy with those
who could not relish the science of the music and the skill
of the combinations. Such instances as this are the best
answer to that school of critics, who have never ceased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
clamouring that Rossini could write nothing but beautiful
tunes to tickle the vulgar and uneducated mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Semiramide,&rdquo; first performed at the Fenice theatre in
Venice on February 3, 1823, was the last of Rossini&rsquo;s
Italian operas, though it had the advantage of careful
rehearsals and a noble caste. It was not well received at
first, though the verdict of time places it high among the
musical masterpieces of the century. In it were combined
all of Rossini&rsquo;s ideas of operatic reform, and the novelty of
some of the innovations probably accounts for the inability
of his earlier public to appreciate its merits. Mdme. Rossini
made her last public appearance in this great work.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Henceforward the career of the greatest of the Italian
composers, the genius who shares with Mozart the honour
of having impressed himself more than any other on the
style and methods of his successors, was to be associated
with French music, though never departing from his characteristic
quality as an original and creative mind. He
modified French music, and left great disciples on whom
his influence was radical, though perhaps we may detect
certain reflex influences in his last and greatest opera,
&ldquo;William Tell.&rdquo; But of this more hereafter.</p>

<p>Before finally settling in the French capital, Rossini
visited London, where he was received with great honours.
&ldquo;When Rossini entered,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> says a writer in a London paper
of that date, &ldquo;he was received with loud plaudits, all the
persons in the pit standing on the seats to get a better view
of him. He continued for a minute or two to bow respectfully
to the audience, and then gave the signal for the
overture to begin. He appeared stout and somewhat below
the middle height, with rather a heavy air, and a countenance
which, though intelligent, betrayed none of the vivacity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
which distinguishes his music; and it was remarked that he
had more of the appearance of a sturdy beef-eating
Englishman than a fiery and sensitive native of the
south.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king, George IV., treated Rossini with peculiar
consideration. On more than one occasion he walked with
him arm-in-arm through a crowded concert-hall to the conductor&rsquo;s
stand. Yet the composer, who seems not to have
admired his English Majesty, treated the monarch with
much independence, not to say brusqueness, on one occasion,
as if to signify his disdain of even royal patronage.
At a grand concert at St. James&rsquo;s Palace, the king said, at
the close of the programme, &ldquo;Now, Rossini, we will have
one piece more, and that shall be the <i>finale</i>.&rdquo; The other
replied, &ldquo;I think, sir, we have had music enough for one
night,&rdquo; and made his bow.</p>

<p>He was an honoured guest at the most fashionable houses,
where his talents as a singer and player were displayed with
much effect in an unconventional, social way. Auber, the
French composer, was present on one of these occasions,
and indicates how great Rossini could have been in
executive music had he not been a king in the higher
sphere. &ldquo;I shall never forget the effect,&rdquo; writes Auber,
&ldquo;produced by his lightning-like execution. When he had
finished I looked mechanically at the ivory keys. I fancied
I could see them smoking.&rdquo; Rossini was richer by seven
thousand pounds by this visit to the English metropolis.
Though he had been under engagement to produce a new
opera as well as to conduct those which had already made
him famous, he failed to keep this part of his contract.
Passages in his letters at this time would seem to indicate
that Rossini was much piqued because the London public
received his wife, to whom he was devotedly attached, with
coldness. Notwithstanding the beauty of her face and
figure, and the greatness of her style both as actress and
singer, she was pronounced <i>pass&eacute;e</i> alike in person and voice,
with a species of brutal frankness not uncommon in English
criticism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
When Rossini arrived in Paris he was almost immediately
appointed director of the Italian Opera by the Duc de
Lauriston. With this and the Acad&eacute;mie he remained connected
till the revolution of 1830. &ldquo;Le Si&eacute;ge de Corinthe,&rdquo;
adapted from his old work, &ldquo;Maometto II.,&rdquo; was the first
opera presented to the Parisian public, and, though
admired, did not become a favourite. The French <i>amour
propre</i> was a little stung when it was made known that
Rossini had simply modified and reshaped one of his early
and immature productions as his first attempt at composition
in French opera. His other works for the French
stage were &ldquo;Il Viaggio a Rheims,&rdquo; &ldquo;Le Comte Ory,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Guillaume Tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last-named opera, which will ever be Rossini&rsquo;s crown
of glory as a composer, was written with his usual rapidity
while visiting the ch&acirc;teau of M. Aguado, a country-seat
some distance from Paris. This work, one of the half-dozen
greatest ever written, was first produced at the Acad&eacute;mie
Royale on August 3, 1829. In its early form of libretto it had
a run of fifty-six representations, and was then withdrawn
from the stage; and the work of remodelling from five to
three acts, and other improvements in the dramatic framework,
was thoroughly carried out. In its new form the
opera blazed into an unprecedented popularity, for of the
greatness of the music there had never been but one judgment.
F&eacute;tis, the eminent critic, writing of it immediately
on its production, said&mdash;&ldquo;The work displays a new man in
an old one, and proves that it is in vain to measure the
action of genius,&rdquo; and follows with&mdash;&ldquo;This production opens
a new career to Rossini,&rdquo; a prophecy unfortunately not to
be realised, for Rossini was soon to retire from the field in
which he had made such a remarkable career, while yet in
the very prime of his powers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guillaume Tell&rdquo; is full of melody, alike in the solos
and the massive choral and ballet music. It runs in rich
streams through every part of the composition. The overture
is better known to the general public than the opera
itself, and is one of the great works of musical art. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
opening andante in triple time for the five violoncelli and
double basses at once carries the hearer to the regions of
the upper Alps, where, amid the eternal snows, Nature sleeps
in a peaceful dream. We perceive the coming of the sunlight,
and the hazy atmosphere clearing away before the
new-born day. In the next movement the solitude is all
dispelled. The raindrops fall thick and heavy, and a
thunderstorm bursts. But the fury is soon spent, and the
clouds clear away. The shepherds are astir, and from the
mountain-sides come the peculiar notes of the &ldquo;Ranz des
Vaches&rdquo; from their pipes. Suddenly all is changed again.
Trumpets call to arms, and with the mustering battalions
the music marks the quickstep, as the shepherd patriots
march to meet the Austrian chivalry. A brilliant use
of the violins and reeds depicts the exultation of the
victors on their return, and closes one of the grandest
sound-paintings in music.</p>

<p>The original cast of &ldquo;Guillaume Tell&rdquo; included the great
singers then in Paris, and these were so delighted with the
music, that the morning after the first production they
assembled on the terrace before his house and performed
selections from it in his honour.</p>

<p>With this last great effort Rossini, at the age of thirty-seven,
may be said to have retired from the field of music,
though his life was prolonged for forty years. True, he
composed the &ldquo;Stabat Mater&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Messe Solennelle,&rdquo;
but neither of these added to the reputation won in his
previous career. The &ldquo;Stabat Mater,&rdquo; publicly performed
for the first time in 1842, has been recognised, it is true,
as a masterpiece; but its entire lack of devotional
solemnity, its brilliant and showy texture, preclude its
giving Rossini any rank as a religious composer.</p>

<p>He spent the forty years of his retirement partly at
Bologna, partly at Passy, near Paris, the city of his adoption.
His hospitality welcomed the brilliant men from all
parts of Europe who loved to visit him, and his relations
with other great musicians were of the most kindly and
cordial character. His sunny and genial nature never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
knew envy, and he was quick to recognise the merits of
schools opposed to his own. He died, after intense suffering,
on November 13, 1868. He had been some time ill,
and four of the greatest physicians in Europe were his
almost constant attendants. The funeral of &ldquo;The Swan of
Pesaro,&rdquo; as he was called by his compatriots, was
attended by an immense concourse, and his remains rest
in P&egrave;re-Lachaise.</p>

His first English appearance in public was at the King&rsquo;s Theatre,
on the 24th of January 1824, when he conducted his own opera,
&ldquo;Zelmira.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Moscheles, the celebrated pianist, gives us some charming
pictures of Rossini in his home at Passy, in his diary of
1860. He writes&mdash;&ldquo;Felix [his son] had been made quite
at home in the villa on former occasions. To me the
<i>parterre salon</i>, with its rich furniture, was quite new, and
before the <i>maestro</i> himself appeared we looked at his photograph
in a circular porcelain frame, on the sides of which
were inscribed the names of his works. The ceiling is
covered with pictures illustrating scenes out of Palestrina&rsquo;s
and Mozart&rsquo;s lives; in the middle of the room stands a
Pleyel piano. When Rossini came in he gave me the
orthodox Italian kiss, and was effusive of expressions of
delight at my reappearance, and very complimentary on the
subject of Felix. In the course of our conversation he was
full of hard-hitting truths on the present study and method
of vocalisation. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear anything more of it,&rsquo;
he said; &lsquo;they scream. All I want is a resonant, full-toned
voice, not a screeching voice. I care not whether it be for
speaking or singing, everything ought to sound melodious.&rsquo;&rdquo;
So, too, Rossini assured Moscheles that he hated the new
school of piano-players, saying the piano was horribly
maltreated, for the performers thumped the keys as if they
had some vengeance to wreak on them. When the great
player improvised for Rossini, the latter says, &ldquo;It is music
that flows from the fountain-head. There is reservoir water
and spring water. The former only runs when you turn the
cock, and is always redolent of the vase; the latter always
gushes forth fresh and limpid. Nowadays people confound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
the simple and the trivial; a <i>motif</i> of Mozart they would
call trivial, if they dared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On other occasions Moscheles plays to the <i>maestro</i>, who
insists on having discovered barriers in the &ldquo;humoristic
variations,&rdquo; so boldly do they seem to raise the standard of
musical revolution; his title of the &ldquo;Grand Valse&rdquo; he finds
too unassuming. &ldquo;Surely a waltz with some angelic creature
must have inspired you, Moscheles, with this composition,
and <em>that</em> the title ought to express. Titles, in fact, should
pique the curiosity of the public.&rdquo; &ldquo;A view uncongenial
to me,&rdquo; adds Moscheles; &ldquo;however, I did not discuss it....
A dinner at Rossini&rsquo;s is calculated for the enjoyment
of a &lsquo;gourmet,&rsquo; and he himself proved to be the one, for he
went through the very select <i>menu</i> as only a connoisseur
would. After dinner he looked through my album of
musical autographs with the greatest interest, and finally we
became very merry, I producing my musical jokes on the
piano, and Felix and Clara figuring in the duet which I had
written for her voice and his imitation of the French horn.
Rossini cheered lustily, and so one joke followed another till
we received the parting kiss and &lsquo;good night.&rsquo; ... At my
next visit, Rossini showed me a charming &lsquo;Lied ohne
Worte,&rsquo; which he composed only yesterday; a graceful
melody is embodied in the well-known technical form.
Alluding to a performance of &lsquo;Semiramide,&rsquo; he said, with a
malicious smile, &lsquo;I suppose you saw the beautiful decorations
in it?&rsquo; He has not received the Sisters Marchisio for
fear they should sing to him, nor has he heard them in the
theatre; he spoke warmly of Pasta, Lablache, Rubini, and
others, then he added that I ought not to look with
jealousy upon his budding talent as a pianoforte-player, but
that, on the contrary, I should help to establish his reputation
as such in Leipsic. He again questioned me with
much interest about my intimacy with Clementi, and, calling
me that master&rsquo;s worthy successor, he said he should like to
visit me in Leipsic, if it were not for those dreadful railways,
which he would never travel by. All this in his bright and
lively way; but when we came to discuss Chevet, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
wishes to supplant musical notes by ciphers, he maintained,
in an earnest and dogmatic tone, that the system of notation,
as it had developed itself since Pope Gregory&rsquo;s time, was
sufficient for all musical requirements. He certainly could
not withhold some appreciation for Chevet, but refused to
indorse the certificate granted by the Institute in his favour;
the system he thought impracticable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The never-failing stream of conversation flowed on
until eleven o&rsquo;clock, when I was favoured with the inevitable
kiss, which on this occasion was accompanied by special
farewell blessings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shortly after Moscheles had left Paris, his son forwarded
to him most friendly messages from Rossini, and continues
thus&mdash;&ldquo;Rossini sends you word that he is working hard at
the piano, and, when you next come to Paris, you shall
find him in better practice.... The conversation turning
upon German music, I asked him &lsquo;which was his favourite
among the great masters?&rsquo; Of Beethoven he said, &lsquo;I take
him twice a-week, Haydn four times, and Mozart every day.
You will tell me that Beethoven is a Colossus who often
gives you a dig in the ribs, while Mozart is always adorable;
it is that the latter had the chance of going very young to
Italy, at a time when they still sang well.&rsquo; Of Weber he
says, &lsquo;He has talent enough, and to spare&rsquo; (<i>Il a du talent &agrave;
revendre, celui-l&agrave;</i>). He told me in reference to him, that,
when the part of &lsquo;Tancred&rsquo; was sung at Berlin by a bass
voice, Weber had written violent articles not only against
the management, but against the composer, so that, when
Weber came to Paris, he did not venture to call on Rossini,
who, however, let him know that he bore him no grudge for
having made these attacks; on receipt of that message
Weber called and they became acquainted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked him if he had met Byron in Venice? &lsquo;Only in
a restaurant,&rsquo; was the answer, &lsquo;where I was introduced to
him; our acquaintance, therefore, was very slight; it seems
he has spoken of me, but I don&rsquo;t know what he says.&rsquo; I
translated for him, in a somewhat milder form, Byron&rsquo;s
words, which happened to be fresh in my memory&mdash;&lsquo;They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
have been crucifying Othello into an opera; the music
good but lugubrious, but, as for the words, all the real
scenes with Iago cut out, and the greatest nonsense instead,
the handkerchief turned into a billet-doux, and the first
singer would not black his face&mdash;singing, dresses, and music
very good.&rsquo; The <i>maestro</i> regretted his ignorance of the
English language, and said, &lsquo;In my day I gave much time
to the study of our Italian literature. Dante is the man I
owe most to; he taught me more music than all my music-masters
put together, and when I wrote my &ldquo;Otello,&rdquo; I
would introduce those lines of Dante&mdash;you know the song
of the gondolier. My librettist would have it that
gondoliers never sang Dante, and but rarely Tasso, but I
answered him, &ldquo;I know all about that better than you, for
I have lived in Venice and you haven&rsquo;t. Dante I must
and will have.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>An ardent disciple of Wagner sums up his ideas of the
mania for the Rossini music, which possessed Europe for
fifteen years, in the following&mdash;&ldquo;Rossini, the most gifted
and spoiled of her sons [speaking of Italy] sallied forth
with an innumerable army of Bacchantic melodies to
conquer the world, the Messiah of joy, the breaker of
thought and sorrow. Europe, by this time, had tired of
the empty pomp of French declamation. It lent but too
willing an ear to the new gospel, and eagerly quaffed the
intoxicating potion, which Rossini poured out in inexhaustible
streams.&rdquo; This very well expresses the delight of all
the countries of Europe in music which for a long time
almost monopolised the stage.</p>

<p>The charge of being a mere tune-spinner, the denial of
invention, depth, and character, have been common watchwords
in the mouths of critics wedded to other schools.
But Rossini&rsquo;s place in music stands unshaken by all assaults.
The vivacity of his style, the freshness of his melodies, the
richness of his combinations, made all the Italian music that
preceded him pale and colourless. No other writer revels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
in such luxury of beauty, and delights the ear with such a
succession of delicious surprises in melody.</p>

<p>Henry Chorley, in his <i>Thirty Years&rsquo; Musical
Recollections</i>, rebukes the bigotry which sees nothing good
but in its own kind&mdash;&ldquo;I have never been able to understand
why this [referring to the Rossinian richness of melody]
should be contemned as necessarily false and meretricious&mdash;why
the poet may not be allowed the benefit of his own
period and time&mdash;why a lover of architecture is to be
compelled to swear by the <i>Dom</i> at Bamberg, or by the
Cathedral at Monreale&mdash;that he must abhor and denounce
Michael Angelo&rsquo;s church or the Baths of Diocletian at
Rome&mdash;why the person who enjoys &lsquo;Il Barbiere&rsquo; is to be
denounced as frivolously faithless to Mozart&rsquo;s &lsquo;Figaro&rsquo;&mdash;and
as incapable of comprehending &lsquo;Fidelio,&rsquo; because the
last act of &lsquo;Otello&rsquo; and the second of &lsquo;Guillaume Tell&rsquo;
transport him into as great an enjoyment of its kind as
do the duet in the cemetery between Don Juan and
Leporello and the &lsquo;Prisoners&rsquo; Chorus.&rsquo; How much good,
genial pleasure has not the world lost in music, owing to
the pitting of styles one against the other! Your true
traveller will be all the more alive to the beauty of
Nuremberg because he has looked out over the &lsquo;Golden
Shell&rsquo; at Palermo; nor delight in Rhine and Danube the
less because he has seen the glow of a southern sunset over
the broken bridge at Avignon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As grand and true as are many of the essential elements
in the Wagner school of musical composition, the bitterness
and narrowness of spite with which its upholders have
pursued the memory of Rossini is equally offensive and
unwarrantable. Rossini, indeed, did not revolutionise the
forms of opera as transmitted to him by his predecessors,
but he reformed and perfected them in various notable
ways. Both in comic and serious opera, music owes much
to Rossini. He substituted genuine singing for the endless
recitative of which the Italian opera before him largely
consisted; he brought the bass and baritone voices to the
front, banished the pianoforte from the orchestra, and laid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
down the principle that the singer should deliver the notes
written for him without additions of his own. He gave the
chorus a much more important part than before, and
elaborated the concerted music, especially in the <i>finales</i>, to
a degree of artistic beauty before unknown in the Italian
opera. Above all, he made the operatic orchestra what it is
to-day. Every new instrument that was invented Rossini
found a place for in his brilliant scores, and thereby incurred
the warmest indignation of all writers of the old school.
Before him the orchestras had consisted largely of strings,
but Rossini added an equally imposing element of the
brasses and reeds. True, Mozart had forestalled Rossini in
many if not all these innovations, a fact which the Italian
cheerfully admitted; for, with the simple frankness
characteristic of the man, he always spoke of his obligations
to and his admiration of the great German. To an admirer
who was one day burning incense before him, Rossini said,
in the spirit of Cimarosa quoted elsewhere, &ldquo;My &lsquo;Barber&rsquo;
is only a bright farce, but in Mozart&rsquo;s &lsquo;Marriage of Figaro&rsquo;
you have the finest possible masterpiece of musical comedy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With all concessions made to Mozart as the founder of
the forms of modern opera, an equally high place must be
given to Rossini for the vigour and audacity with which he
made these available, and impressed them on all his contemporaries
and successors. Though Rossini&rsquo;s self-love was
flattered by constant adulation, his expressions of respect
and admiration for such composers as Mozart, Gluck, Beethoven,
and Cherubini, display what a catholic and generous
nature he possessed. The judgment of Ambros, a
severe critic, whose bias was against Rossini, shows what
admiration was wrung from him by the last opera of the
composer&mdash;&ldquo;Of all that particularly characterises Rossini&rsquo;s
early operas nothing is discoverable in &lsquo;Tell;&rsquo; there is
none of his usual mannerism; but, on the contrary, unusual
richness of form and careful finish of detail, combined with
grandeur of outline. Meretricious embellishment, shakes,
runs, and cadences are carefully avoided in this work, which
is natural and characteristic throughout; even the melodies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
have not the stamp and style of Rossini&rsquo;s earlier times, but
only their graceful charm and lively colouring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rossini must be allowed to be unequalled in genuine
comic opera, and to have attained a distinct greatness in
serious opera, to be the most comprehensive, and, at the
same time, the most national composer of Italy&mdash;to be, in
short, the Mozart of his country. After all has been
admitted and regretted&mdash;that he gave too little attention
to musical science; that he often neglected to infuse into
his work the depth and passion of which it was easily
capable; that he placed too high a value on merely brilliant
effects <i>ad captandum vulgus</i>&mdash;there remains the fact that
his operas embody a mass of imperishable music, which will
live with the art itself. Musicians of every country now
admit his wondrous grace, his fertility and freshness of
invention, his matchless treatment of the voice, his effectiveness
in arrangement of the orchestra. He can never be
made a model, for his genius had too much spontaneity and
individuality of colour. But he impressed and modified
music hardly less than Gluck, whose tastes and methods
were entirely antagonistic to his own. That he should
have retired from the exercise of his art while in the full
flower of his genius is a perplexing fact. No stranger story
is recorded in the annals of art with respect to a genius
who filled the world with his glory, and then chose to
vanish, &ldquo;not unseen.&rdquo; On finishing his crowning stroke of
genius and skill in &ldquo;William Tell,&rdquo; he might have said
with Shakespeare&rsquo;s enchanter, Prospero&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="donizetti" id="donizetti"></a><i>DONIZETTI AND BELLINI.</i></h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A bright</span> English critic, whose style is as charming as his
judgments are good, says, in his study of the Donizetti
music, &ldquo;I find myself thinking of his music as I do of
Domenichino&rsquo;s pictures of &lsquo;St. Agnes&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Rosario&rsquo;
in the Bologna gallery, of the &lsquo;Diana&rsquo; in the Borghese
Palace at Rome, as pictures equable and skilful in the
treatment of their subjects, neither devoid of beauty of
form nor of colour, but which make neither the pulse quiver
nor the eye wet; and then such a sweeping judgment is
arrested by a work like the &lsquo;St. Jerome&rsquo; in the Vatican,
from which a spirit comes forth so strong and so exalted,
that the beholder, however trained to examine and compare
and collect, finds himself raised above all recollections
of manner by the sudden ascent of talent into the higher
world of genius. Essentially a second-rate composer,<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>
Donizetti struck out some first-rate things in a happy
hour, such as the last act of &lsquo;La Favorita.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both Donizetti and Bellini, though far inferior to their
master in richness of resources, in creative faculty and
instinct for what may be called dramatic expression in pure
musical form, were disciples of Rossini in their ideas and
methods of work. Milton sang of Shakespeare&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy&rsquo;s child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warbles his native wood-notes wild!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In a similar spirit, many learned critics have written of
Rossini, and if it can be said of him in a musical sense that
he had &ldquo;little Latin and less Greek,&rdquo; still more true is it
of the two popular composers whose works have filled so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
large a space in the opera-house of the last thirty years, for
their scores are singularly thin, measured by the standard
of advanced musical science. Specially may this be said of
Bellini, in many respects the greater of the two. There is
scarcely to be found in music a more signal example to
show that a marked individuality may rest on a narrow
base. In justice to him, however, it may be said that his
early death prevented him from doing full justice to his
powers, for he had in him the material out of which the
great artist is made. Let us first sketch the career of
Donizetti, the author of sixty-four operas, besides a mass of
other music, such as cantatas, ariettas, duets, church music,
etc., in the short space of twenty-six years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">G&auml;etano Donizetti</span> was born at Bergamo, 25th September
1798, his father being a man of moderate fortune.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> Receiving
a good classical education, the young G&auml;etano had
three careers open before him: the bar, to which the will
of his father inclined; architecture, indicated by his talent
for drawing; and music, to which he was powerfully impelled
by his own inclinations. His father sent him, at the
age of seventeen, to Bologna to benefit by the instruction
of Padre Mattei, who had also been Rossini&rsquo;s master. The
young man showed no disposition for the heights of musical
science as demanded by religious composition, and, much to
his father&rsquo;s disgust, avowed his determination to write
dramatic music. Paternal anger, for the elder Donizetti
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
seems to have had a strain of Scotch obstinacy and
austerity, made the youth enlist as a soldier, thinking to
find time for musical work in the leisure of barrack-life.
His first opera, &ldquo;Enrico di Borgogna,&rdquo; was so highly
admired by the Venetian manager, to whom it was offered,
that he induced friends of his to release young Donizetti
from his military servitude. He now pursued musical
composition with a facility and industry which astonished
even the Italians, familiar with feats of improvisation. In
ten years twenty-eight operas were produced. Such names
as &ldquo;Olivo e Pasquale,&rdquo; &ldquo;La Convenienze Teatrali,&rdquo; &ldquo;Il Borgomaestro
di Saardam,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gianni di Calais,&rdquo; &ldquo;L&rsquo;Esule di
Roma,&rdquo; &ldquo;Il Castello di Kenilworth,&rdquo; &ldquo;Imelda di Lambertazzi,&rdquo;
have no musical significance, except as belonging to
a catalogue of forgotten titles. Donizetti was so poorly
paid that need drove him to rapid composition, which could
not wait for the true afflatus.</p>

<p>It was not till 1831 that the evidence of a strong individuality
was given, for hitherto he had shown little more
than a slavish imitation of Rossini. &ldquo;Anna Bolena&rdquo; was
produced at Milan and gained him great credit, and even
now, though it is rarely sung even in Italy, it is much
respected as a work of art as well as of promise. It was
first interpreted by Pasta and Rubini, and Lablache won
his earliest London triumph in it. &ldquo;Marino Faliero&rdquo; was
composed for Paris in 1835, and &ldquo;L&rsquo;Elisir d&rsquo;Amore,&rdquo; one
of the most graceful and pleasing of Donizetti&rsquo;s works, for
Milan in 1832. &ldquo;Lucia di Lammermoor,&rdquo; based on Sir
Walter Scott&rsquo;s novel, was given to the public in 1835, and
has remained the most popular of the composer&rsquo;s operas.
Edgardo was written for the great French tenor, Duprez,
Lucia for Persiani.</p>

<p>Donizetti&rsquo;s kindness of heart was illustrated by the interesting
circumstances of his saving an obscure Neapolitan
theatre from ruin. Hearing that it was on the verge of
suspension and the performers in great distress, the composer
sought them out and supplied their immediate wants.
The manager said a new work from the pen of Donizetti
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
would be his salvation. &ldquo;You shall have one within a
week,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>

<p>Lacking a subject, he himself rearranged an old French
vaudeville, and within the week the libretto was written,
the music composed, the parts learned, the opera performed,
and the theatre saved. There could be no greater proof of
his generosity of heart and his versatility of talent. In
these days of bitter quarrelling over the rights of authors
in their works, it may be amusing to know that Victor
Hugo contested the rights of Italian librettists to borrow
their plots from French plays. When &ldquo;Lucrezia Borgia,&rdquo;
composed for Milan in 1834, was produced at Paris in
1840, the French poet instituted a suit for an infringement
of copyright. He gained his action, and &ldquo;Lucrezia Borgia&rdquo;
became &ldquo;La Rinegata,&rdquo; Pope Alexander the Sixth&rsquo;s
Italians being metamorphosed into Turks.<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucrezia Borgia,&rdquo; which, though based on one of the
most dramatic of stories and full of beautiful music, is not
dramatically treated by the composer, seems to mark the
distance about half-way between the styles of Rossini and
Verdi. In it there is but little recitative, and in the treatment
of the chorus we find the method which Verdi afterwards
came to use exclusively. When Donizetti revisited
Paris in 1840, he produced in rapid succession &ldquo;I Martiri,&rdquo;
&ldquo;La Fille du Regiment,&rdquo; and &ldquo;La Favorita.&rdquo; In the
second of these works Jenny Lind, Sontag, and Alboni won
bright triumphs at a subsequent period.</p>

Admirers of the author of &ldquo;Don Pasquale&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lucia&rdquo; may be
interested in knowing that Donizetti was of Scotch descent. His
grandfather was a native of Perthshire, named Izett. The young
Scot was beguiled by the fascinating tongue of a recruiting-sergeant
into his Britannic majesty&rsquo;s service, and was taken prisoner by
General La Hoche during the latter&rsquo;s invasion of Ireland. Already
tired of a private&rsquo;s life, he accepted the situation, and was induced to
become the French general&rsquo;s private secretary. Subsequently he
drifted to Italy, and married an Italian lady of some rank, denationalising
his own name into Donizetti. The Scottish predilections of
our composer show themselves in the music of &ldquo;Don Pasquale,&rdquo;
noticeably in &ldquo;Com&rsquo; e gentil;&rdquo; and the score of &ldquo;Lucia&rdquo; is strongly
flavoured by Scottish sympathy and minstrelsy.</p>

<div class="footnote">

Victor Hugo did the same thing with Verdi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ernani,&rdquo; and
other French authors followed with legal actions. The matter was
finally arranged on condition of an indemnity being paid to the
original French dramatists. The principle involved had been established
nearly two centuries before. In a privilege granted to St.
Amant in 1653 for the publication of his &ldquo;Mo&iuml;se Sauv&eacute;,&rdquo; it was forbidden
to extract from that epic materials for a play or poem. The
descendants of Beaumarchais fought for the same concession, and not
very long ago it was decided that the translators and arrangers of
&ldquo;Le Nozze di Figaro&rdquo; for the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Lyrique must share their
receipts with the living representatives of the author of &ldquo;Le Mariage
de Figaro.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span></p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;La Favorita,&rdquo; the story of which was drawn from
&ldquo;L&rsquo;Ange de Nisida,&rdquo; and founded in the first instance on
a French play, &ldquo;Le Comte de Commingues,&rdquo; was put on
the stage at the Acad&eacute;mie with a magnificent cast and
scenery, and achieved a success immediately great, for as a
dramatic opera it stands far in the van of all the composer&rsquo;s
productions. The whole of the grand fourth act, with the
exception of one cavatina, was composed in three hours.
Donizetti had been dining at the house of a friend, who was
engaged in the evening to go to a ball. On leaving the
house his host, with profuse apologies, begged the composer
to stay and finish his coffee, of which Donizetti was inordinately
fond. The latter sent out for music paper, and,
finding himself in the vein for composition, went on writing
till the completion of the work. He had just put the final
stroke to the celebrated &ldquo;Viens dans un autre patrie&rdquo; when
his friend returned at one in the morning to congratulate
him on his excellent method of passing the time, and to
hear the music sung for the first time from Donizetti&rsquo;s own
lips.</p>

<p>After visiting Rome, Milan, and Vienna, for which last
city he wrote &ldquo;Linda di Chamouni,&rdquo; our composer returned
to Paris, and in 1843 wrote &ldquo;Don Pasquale&rdquo; for the
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Italien, and &ldquo;Don Sebastian&rdquo; for the Acad&eacute;mie.
Its lugubrious drama was fatal to the latter, but the brilliant
gaiety of &ldquo;Don Pasquale,&rdquo; rendered specially delightful
by such a cast as Grisi, Mario, Tamburini, and Lablache,
made it one of the great art attractions of Paris, and a
Fortunatus purse for the manager. The music of this work,
perhaps, is the best ever written by Donizetti, though it
lacks the freshness and sentiment of his &ldquo;Elisir d&rsquo;Amore,&rdquo;
which is steeped in rustic poetry and tenderness like a rose
wet with dew. The production of &ldquo;Maria di Rohan&rdquo; in
Vienna the same year, an opera with some powerful dramatic
effects and bold music, gave Ronconi the opportunity
to prove himself not merely a fine buffo singer, but a noble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>
tragic actor. In this work Donizetti displays that rugged
earnestness and vigour so characteristic of Verdi; and, had
his life been greatly prolonged, we might have seen him
ripen into a passion and power at odds with the elegant
frivolity which for the most part tainted his musical quality.
Donizetti&rsquo;s last opera, &ldquo;Catarina Comaro,&rdquo; the sixty-third
one represented, was brought out at Naples in the year
1844, without adding aught to his reputation. Of this
composer&rsquo;s long list of works only ten or eleven retain any
hold on the stage, his best serious operas being &ldquo;La
Favorita,&rdquo; &ldquo;Linda,&rdquo; &ldquo;Anna Bolena,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lucrezia Borgia,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Lucia;&rdquo; the finest comic works, &ldquo;L&rsquo;Elisir d&rsquo;Amore,&rdquo;
&ldquo;La Fille du Regiment,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Don Pasquale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In composing Donizetti never used the pianoforte, writing
with great rapidity and never making corrections. Yet
curious to say, he could not do anything without a small
ivory scraper by his side, though never using it. It was
given him by his father when commencing his career, with
the injunction that, as he was determined to become a
musician, he should make up his mind to write as little
rubbish as possible, advice which Donizetti sometimes
forgot.</p>

<p>The first signs of the malady, which was the cause of the
composer&rsquo;s death, had already shown themselves in 1845.
Fits of hallucination and all the symptoms of approaching
derangement displayed themselves with increasing intensity.
An incessant worker, overseer of his operas on twenty
stages, he had to pay the tax by which his fame became
his ruin. It is reported that he anticipated the coming
scourge, for during the rehearsals of &ldquo;Don Sebastian&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;I think I shall go mad yet.&rdquo; Still he would not
put the bridle on his restless activity. At last paralysis
seized him, and in January 1846 he was placed under the
care of the celebrated Dr. Blanche at Ivry. In the hope
that the mild influence of his native air might heal his
distempered brain, he was sent to Bergamo, in 1848, but
died in his brother&rsquo;s arms April 8th. The inhabitants of
the Peninsula were then at war with Austria, and the bells
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span>
that sounded the knell of Donizetti&rsquo;s departure mingled
their solemn peals with the roar of the cannon fired to
celebrate the victory of Go&iuml;to.</p>

<p>His faithful valet, Antoine, wrote to Adolphe Adam,
describing his obsequies:&mdash;&ldquo;More than four thousand
persons,&rdquo; he relates, &ldquo;were present at the ceremony. The
procession was composed of the numerous clergy of
Bergamo, the most illustrious members of the community
and its environs, and of the civic guard of the town and
the suburbs. The discharge of musketry, mingled with the
light of three or four thousand torches, presented a fine
effect; the whole was enhanced by the presence of three
military bands and the most propitious weather it was
possible to behold. The young gentlemen of Bergamo
insisted on bearing the remains of their illustrious fellow-townsman,
although the cemetery was a league and a-half
from the town. The road was crowded its whole length by
people who came from the surrounding country to witness
the procession; and to give due praise to the inhabitants of
Bergamo, never, hitherto, had such great honours been
bestowed upon any member of that city.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The future author of &ldquo;Norma&rdquo; and &ldquo;La Sonnambula,&rdquo;
Bellini, took his first lessons in music from his father, an
organist at Catania.<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> He was sent to the Naples Conservatory
by the generosity of a noble patron, and there was the
fellow-pupil of Mercadante, a composer who blazed into a
temporary lustre which threatened to outshine his fellows,
but is now forgotten except by the antiquarian and the
lover of church music. Bellini&rsquo;s early works, for he composed
three before he was twenty, so pleased Barbaja, the
manager of the San Carlo and La Scala, that he intrusted
the youth with the libretto &ldquo;Il Pirata,&rdquo; to be composed for
representation at Florence. The tenor part was written for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>207]</a></span>
the great singer, Rubini, whose name has no peer among
artists since male sopranos were abolished by the outraged
moral sense of society. Rubini retired to the country with
Bellini, and studied, as they were produced, the simple
touching airs with which he so delighted the public on the
stage.</p>

<p>La Scala rang with plaudits when the opera was
produced, and Bellini&rsquo;s career was assured. &ldquo;I Capuletti&rdquo;
was his next successful opera, performed at Venice in 1829,
but it never became popular out of Italy.</p>

<p>The significant period of Bellini&rsquo;s life was in the year
1831, which produced &ldquo;La Sonnambula,&rdquo; to be followed by
&ldquo;Norma&rdquo; the next season. Both these were written for and
introduced before the Neapolitan public. In these works he
reached his highest development, and by them he is best
known to fame. The opera-story of &ldquo;La Sonnambula,&rdquo; by
Romani, an accomplished writer and scholar, is one of the
most artistic and effective ever put into the hands of a
composer. M. Scribe had already used the plot, both as
the subject of a vaudeville and a choregraphic drama; but
in Romani&rsquo;s hands it became a symmetrical story full of
poetry and beauty. The music of this opera, throbbing
with pure melody and simple emotion, as natural and fresh
as a bed of wild flowers, went to the heart of the universal
public, learned and unlearned; and, in spite of its scientific
faults, it will never cease to delight future generations, as
long as hearts beat and eyes are moistened with human
tenderness and sympathy. And yet, of this work an
English critic wrote, on its first London presentation:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bellini has soared too high; there is nothing of
grandeur, no touch of true pathos in the commonplace
workings of his mind. He cannot reach the <i>opera semiseria</i>;
he should confine his powers to the musical drama,
the one-act <i>opera buffa</i>.&rdquo; But the history of art-criticism
is replete with such instances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Norma&rdquo; was also a grand triumph for the young
composer from the outset, especially as the lofty character
of the Druid priestess was sung by that unapproachable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
lyric tragedienne, the Siddons of the opera, Madame Pasta.
Bellini is said to have had this queen of dramatic song in
his mind in writing the opera, and right nobly did she
vindicate his judgment, for no European audience afterwards
but was thrilled and carried away by her masterpiece of
acting and singing in this part.</p>

<p>Bellini himself considered &ldquo;Norma&rdquo; his <i>chef-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i>.
A beautiful Parisienne attempted to extract from his
reluctant lips his preference of his own works. The lady
finally overcame his evasions by the query, &ldquo;But if you
were out at sea, and should be shipwrecked&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
he cried, without allowing her to finish. &ldquo;I would leave
all the rest and try to save &lsquo;Norma.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I Puritani&rdquo; was composed for and performed at Paris
in 1834, by that splendid quartette of artists, Grisi, Rubini,
Tamburini, and Lablache. Bellini compelled the singers to
execute after <em>his</em> style. While Rubini was rehearsing the
tenor part, the composer cried out in rage, &ldquo;You put no
life into your music. Show some feeling. Don&rsquo;t you know
what love is?&rdquo; Then changing his tone, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
know your voice is a gold-mine that has not been fully
explored? You are an excellent artist, but that is not
sufficient. You must forget yourself and represent
Gualtiero. Let&rsquo;s try again.&rdquo; The tenor, stung by the
admonition, then gave the part magnificently. After the
success of &ldquo;I Puritani,&rdquo; the composer received the Cross
of the Legion of Honour, an honour then not often
bestowed. The &ldquo;Puritani&rdquo; season is still remembered, it
is said, with peculiar pleasure by the older connoisseurs of
Paris and London, as the enthusiasm awakened in musical
circles has rarely been equalled.</p>

<p>Bellini had placed himself under contract to write two
new works immediately, one for Paris, the other for Naples,
and retired to the villa of a friend at Puteaux to insure the
more complete seclusion. Here, while pursuing his art
with almost sleepless ardour, he was attacked by his fatal
malady, intestinal fever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From his youth up,&rdquo; says his biographer Mould,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
&ldquo;Vincenzo&rsquo;s eagerness in his art was such as to keep him
at the piano night and day, till he was obliged forcibly to
leave it. The ruling passion accompanied him through his
short life, and by the assiduity with which he pursued it
brought on the dysentery which closed his brilliant career,
peopling his last hours with the figures of those to whom
his works owed so much of their success. During the
moments of delirium which preceded his death, he was constantly
speaking of Lablache, Tamburini, and Grisi; and
one of his last recognisable impressions was that he was
present at a brilliant representation of his last opera at the
Salle Favart.&rdquo; His earthly career closed September 23, 1835,
at the age of thirty-three.</p>

<p>On the eve of his interment, the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Italien reopened
with the &ldquo;Puritani.&rdquo; It was an occasion full of solemn
gloom. Both the musicians and audience broke from time
to time into sobs. Tamburini, in particular, was so
oppressed by the death of his young friend that his vocalisation,
generally so perfect, was often at fault, while the
faces of Grisi, Rubini, and Lablache too plainly showed
their aching hearts.</p>

<p>Rossini, Cherubini, Paer, and Carafa had charge of the
funeral, and M. Habeneck, <i>chef d&rsquo;orchestre</i> of the Acad&eacute;mie
Royale, of the music. The next remarkable piece on the
funeral programme was a <i>Lacrymosa</i> for four voices without
accompaniment, in which the text of the Latin hymn was
united to the beautiful tenor melody in the third act of the
&ldquo;Puritani.&rdquo; This was executed by Rubini, Ivanoff, Tamburini,
and Lablache. The services were performed at the
Church of the Invalides, and the remains were interred in
P&egrave;re Lachaise.</p>

<p>Rossini had ever shown great love for Bellini, and
Rosario Bellini, the stricken father, wrote to him a touching
letter, in which, after speaking of his grief and despair, the
old man said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You always encouraged the object of my eternal regret
in his labours; you took him under your protection, you
neglected nothing that could increase his glory and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
welfare. After my son&rsquo;s death, what have you not done to
honour my son&rsquo;s name and render it dear to posterity? I
learned this from the newspapers; and I am penetrated
with gratitude for your excessive kindness as well as for
that of a number of distinguished artists, which also I shall
never forget. Pray, sir, be my interpreter, and tell these
artists that the father and family of Bellini, as well as of
our compatriots of Catania, will cherish an imperishable
recollection of this generous conduct. I shall never cease
to remember how much you did for my son. I shall make
known everywhere, in the midst of my tears, what an
affectionate heart belongs to the great Rossini, and how
kind, hospitable, and full of feeling are the artists of
France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bellini was affable, sincere, honest, and affectionate.
Nature gave him a beautiful and ingenuous face, noble
features, large, clear blue eyes, and abundant light hair.
His countenance instantly won on the regards of all that
met him. His disposition was melancholy; a secret
depression often crept over his most cheerful hours. We
are told there was a tender romance in his earlier life. The
father of the lady he loved, a Neapolitan judge, refused his
suit on account of his inferior social position. When
Bellini became famous the judge wished to make amends,
but Bellini&rsquo;s pride interfered. Soon after the young lady,
who loved him unalterably, died, and it is said the composer
never recovered from the shock.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Donizetti and Bellini were peculiarly moulded by the
great genius of Rossini, but in their best works they show
individuality, colour, and special creative activity. The
former composer, one of the most affluent in the annals of
music, seemed to become more fresh in his fancies with
increased production. He is an example of how little the
skill and touch, belonging to unceasing work, should be
despised in comparison with what is called inspiration.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
Donizetti arrived at his freshest creations at a time when
there seemed but little left for him except the trite and
threadbare. There are no melodies so rich and well fancied
as those to be found in his later works; and in sense of
dramatic form and effective instrumentation (always a
faulty point with Donizetti) he displayed great progress at
the last. It is, however, a noteworthy fact, that the latest
Italian composers have shown themselves quite weak in
composing expressly for the orchestra. No operatic overture
since &ldquo;William Tell&rdquo; has been produced by this
school of music, worthy to be rendered in a concert-room.</p>

<p>Donizetti lacked the dramatic instinct in conceiving
his music. In attempting it he became hollow and
theatric; and beautiful as are the melodies and concerted
pieces in &ldquo;Lucia,&rdquo; where the subject ought to inspire a
vivid dramatic nature with such telling effects, it is in the
latter sense one of the most disappointing of operas.</p>

<p>He redeemed himself for the nonce, however, in the
fourth act of &ldquo;La Favorita,&rdquo; where there is enough
musical and dramatic beauty to condone the sins of the
other three acts. The solemn and affecting church chant,
the passionate romance for the tenor, the great closing duet
in which the ecstasy of despair rises to that of exaltation,
the resistless sweep of the rhythm&mdash;all mark one of the
most effective single acts ever written. He showed himself
here worthy of companionship with Rossini and
Meyerbeer.</p>

<p>In his comic operas, &ldquo;L&rsquo;Elisir d&rsquo;Amore,&rdquo; &ldquo;La Fille du
Regiment,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Don Pasquale,&rdquo; there is a continual
well-spring of sunny, bubbling humour. They are slight,
brilliant, and catching, everything that pedantry condemns,
and the popular taste delights in. Mendelssohn, the last of
the German classical composers, admired &ldquo;L&rsquo;Elisir,&rdquo; so
much that he said he would have liked to have written it
himself. It may be said that while Donizetti lacks grand
conceptions, or even great beauties for the most part, his
operas contain so much that is agreeable, so many excellent
opportunities for vocal display, such harmony between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
sound and situation, that he will probably retain a hold on
the stage when much greater composers are only known to
the general public by name.</p>

<p>Bellini, with less fertility and grace, possessed far more
picturesqueness and intensity. His powers of imagination
transcended his command over the working tools of his art.
Even more lacking in exact and extended musical science
than Donizetti, he could express what came within his
range with a simple vigour, grasp, and beauty, which make
him a truly dramatic composer. In addition to this, a
matter which many great composers ignore, Bellini had
extraordinary skill in writing music for the voice, not that
which merely gave opportunity for executive trickery and
embellishment, but the genuine accents of passion, pathos, and
tenderness, in forms best adapted to be easily and effectively
delivered.</p>

<p>He had no flexibility, no command over mirthful
inspiration, such as we hear in Mozart, Rossini, or even
Donizetti. But his monotone is in subtile <i>rapport</i> with the
graver aspects of nature and life. Chorley sums up this
characteristic of Bellini in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In spite of the inexperience with which the instrumental
score is filled up, the opening scene of &lsquo;Norma&rsquo; in
the dim druidical wood bears the true character of ancient
sylvan antiquity. There is daybreak again&mdash;a fresh tone
of reveille&mdash;in the prelude to &lsquo;I Puritani.&rsquo; If Bellini&rsquo;s
genius was not versatile in its means of expression, if it had
not gathered all the appliances by which science fertilises
Nature, it beyond all doubt included appreciation of truth,
no less than instinct for beauty.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="verdi" id="verdi"></a><i>VERDI.</i></h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1872 the Kh&eacute;dive of Egypt, an oriental ruler, whose
love of western art and civilisation has since tangled him in
economic meshes to escape from which has cost him his
independence, produced a new opera with barbaric splendour
of appointments, at Grand Cairo. The spacious theatre
blazed with fantastic dresses and showy uniforms, and the
curtain rose on a drama which gave a glimpse to the Arabs,
Copts, and Franks present of the life and religion, the loves
and hates of ancient Pharaonic times, set to music by the
most celebrated of living Italian composers.</p>

<p>That an eastern prince should have commissioned
Giuseppe Verdi to write &ldquo;Aida&rdquo; for him, in his desire
to emulate western sovereigns as a patron of art, is an
interesting fact, but not wonderful or significant.</p>

<p>The opera itself was freighted, however, with peculiar
significance as an artistic work, far surpassing that of the
circumstances which gave it origin, or which saw its first
production in the mysterious land of the Nile and Sphinx.</p>

<p>Originally a pupil, thoroughly imbued with the method
and spirit of Rossini, though never lacking in original
quality, Verdi as a young man shared the suffrages of
admiring audiences with Donizetti and Bellini. Even
when he diverged widely from his parent stem and took rank
as the representative of the melodramatic school of music,
he remained true to the instincts of his Italian training.</p>

<p>The remarkable fact is that Verdi, at the age of fifty-eight,
when it might have been safely assumed that his
theories and preferences were finally crystallised, produced
an opera in which he clasped hands with the German
enthusiast, who preached an art system radically opposed
to his own, and lashed with scathing satire the whole
musical cult of the Italian race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
In &ldquo;Aida&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Manzoni Mass,&rdquo; written in 1873,
Verdi, the leader among living Italian composers, practically
conceded that, in the long, bitterly fought battle
between Teuton and Italian in music, the former was the
victor. In the opera we find a new departure, which, if
not embodying all the philosophy of the &ldquo;new school,&rdquo; is
stamped with its salient traits&mdash;viz., the subordination of
all the individual effects to the perfection and symmetry of
the whole; a lavish demand on all the sister arts to
contribute their rich gifts to the heightening of the
illusion; a tendency to enrich the harmonic value in the
choruses, the concerted pieces, and the instrumentation, to
the great sacrifice of the solo pieces; the use of the heroic
and mythical element as a theme.</p>

<p>Verdi, the subject of this interesting revolution, has
filled a very brilliant place in modern musical art, and his
career has been in some ways as picturesque as his music.</p>

<p>Verdi&rsquo;s parents were literally hewers of wood and
drawers of water, earning their bread, after the manner
of Italian peasants, at a small settlement called La Roncali,
near Busseto, where the future composer was born on
October 9, 1813.</p>

<p>His earliest recollections were with the little village
church, where the little Giuseppe listened with delight to
the church organ, for, as with all great musicians, his
fondness for music showed itself at a very early age. The
elder Verdi, though very poor, gratified the child&rsquo;s love of
music when he was about eight by buying a small spinet,
and placing him under the instruction of Provesi, a teacher
in Busseto. The boy entered on his studies with ardour,
and made more rapid progress than the slender facilities
which were allowed him would ordinarily justify.</p>

<p>An event soon occurred which was destined to wield a
lasting influence on his destiny. He one day heard a
skilful performance on a fine piano, while passing by one
of the better houses of Busseto. From that time a constant
fascination drew him to the house; for day after day he
lingered and seemed unwilling to go away lest he should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
perchance lose some of the enchanting sounds which so
enraptured him. The owner of the premises was a rich
merchant, one Antonio Barezzi, a cultivated and high-minded
man, and a passionate lover of music withal.
&rsquo;Twas his daughter whose playing gave the young Verdi
such pleasure.</p>

<p>Signor Barezzi had often seen the lingering and absorbed
lad, who stood as if in a dream, oblivious to all that passed
around him in the practical work-a-day world. So one day
he accosted him pleasantly and inquired why he came so
constantly and stayed so long doing nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I play the piano a little,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;and I like to
come here and listen to the fine playing in your house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! if that is the case, come in with me that you may
enjoy it more at your ease, and hereafter you are welcome
to do so whenever you feel inclined.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It may be imagined the delighted boy did not refuse the
kind invitation, and the acquaintance soon ripened into
intimacy, for the rich merchant learned to regard the
bright young musician with much affection, which it is
needless to say was warmly returned. Verdi was untiring
in study and spent the early years of his youth in humble
quiet, in the midst of those beauties of nature which have
so powerful an influence in moulding great susceptibilities.
At his seventeenth year he had acquired as much musical
knowledge as could be acquired at a place like Busseto, and he
became anxious to go to Milan to continue his studies. The
poverty of his family precluding any assistance from this quarter,
he was obliged to find help from an eleemosynary fund
then existing in his native town. This was an institution
called the Monte di Piet&agrave;, which offered yearly to four young
men the sum of twenty-five <i>lire</i> a-month each, in order to help
them to an education; and Verdi, making an application and
sustained by the influence of his friend the rich merchant,
was one of the four whose good fortune it was to be selected.</p>

<p>The allowance thus obtained, with some assistance from
Barezzi, enabled the ambitious young musician to go to
Milan, carrying with him some of his compositions. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
he presented himself for examination at the Conservatory,
he was made to play on the piano, and his compositions
examined. The result fell on his hopes like a thunderbolt.
The pedantic and narrow-minded examiners not only scoffed
at the state of his musical knowledge, but told him he was
incapable of becoming a musician. To weaker souls this
would have been a terrible discouragement, but to his
ardour and self-confidence it was only a challenge. Barezzi
had equal confidence in the abilities of his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, and
warmly encouraged him to work and hope. Verdi engaged
an excellent private teacher and pursued his studies with
unflagging energy, denying himself all but the barest
necessities, and going sometimes without sufficient food.</p>

<p>A stroke of fortune now fell in his way; the place of
organist fell vacant at the Busseto church, and Verdi was
appointed to fill it. He returned home, and was soon
afterwards married to the daughter of the benefactor to
whom he owed so much. He continued to apply himself
with great diligence to the study of his art, and completed
an opera early in 1839. He succeeded in arranging for the
production of this work, &ldquo;L&rsquo;Oberto, Conte de San Bonifacio,&rdquo;
at La Scala, Milan; but it excited little comment and was
soon forgotten, like the scores of other shallow or immature
compositions so prolifically produced in Italy.</p>

<p>The impresario, Merelli, believed in the young composer
though, for he thought he discovered signs of genius. So
he gave him a contract to write three operas, one of which
was to be an <i>opera buffa</i>, and to be ready in the following
autumn. With hopeful spirits Verdi set to work on the
opera, but that year of 1840 was to be one of great trouble
and trial. Hardly had he set to work all afire with
eagerness and hope, when he was seized with severe illness.
His recovery was followed by the successive sickening of
his two children, who died, a terrible blow to the father&rsquo;s
fond heart. Fate had the crowning stroke though still to
give, for the young mother, agonised by this loss, was
seized with a fatal inflammation of the brain. Thus within
a brief period Verdi was bereft of all the sweet consolations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>217]</a></span>
of home, and his life became a burden to him. Under these
conditions he was to write a comic opera, full of sparkle,
gaiety, and humour. Can we wonder that his work was a
failure? The public came to be amused by bright, joyous
music, for it was nothing to them that the composer&rsquo;s heart
was dead with grief at his afflictions. The audience hissed
&ldquo;Un Giorno di Regno,&rdquo; for it proved a funereal attempt at
mirth. So Verdi sought to annul the contract.</p>

<p>To this the impresario replied&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So be it, if you wish; but, whenever you want to write
again on the same terms, you will find me ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To tell the truth, the composer was discouraged by his
want of success, and wholly broken down by his numerous
trials. He now withdrew from all society, and, having
hired a small room in an out-of-the-way part of Milan,
passed most of his time in reading the worst books that
could be found, rarely going out, unless occasionally in the
evening, never giving his attention to study of any kind,
and never touching the piano. Such was his life from
October 1840 to January 1841. One evening, early in
the new year, while out walking, he chanced to meet
Merelli, who took him by the arm; and, as they sauntered
towards the theatre, the impresario told him that he was in
great trouble, Nicolai, who was to write an opera for him,
having refused to accept a <i>libretto</i> entitled &ldquo;Nabucco.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this Verdi replied&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to be able to relieve you of your difficulty.
Don&rsquo;t you remember the libretto of &lsquo;Il Proscritto,&rsquo; which
you procured for me, and for which I have never composed
the music? Give that to Nicolai in place of &lsquo;Nabucco.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Merelli thanked him for his kind offer, and, as they
reached the theatre, asked him to go in, that they might
ascertain whether the manuscript of &ldquo;Il Proscritto&rdquo; was
really there. It was at length found, and Verdi was on the
point of leaving, when Merelli slipped into his pocket the
book of &ldquo;Nabucco,&rdquo; asking him to look it over. For want
of something to do, he took up the drama the next morning
and read it through, realising how truly grand it was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>218]</a></span>
conception. But, as a lover forces himself to feign indifference
to his coquettish <i>innamorata</i>, so he, disregarding
his inclinations, returned the manuscript to Merelli that
same day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Merelli, inquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Musicabilissimo!</em>&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;full of dramatic power
and telling situations!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it home with you, then, and write the music for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verdi declared that he did not wish to compose, but the
worthy impresario forced the manuscript on him, and persisted
that he should undertake the work. The composer
returned home with the libretto, but threw it on one side
without looking at it, and for the next five months continued
his reading of bad romances and yellow-covered novels.</p>

<p>The impulse of work soon came again, however. One
beautiful June day the manuscript met his eye, while
looking listlessly over some old papers. He read one scene
and was struck by its beauty. The instinct of musical
creation rushed over him with irresistible force; he seated
himself at the piano, so long silent, and began composing
the music. The ice was broken. Verdi soon entered into
the spirit of the work, and in three months &ldquo;Nabucco&rdquo; was
entirely completed. Merelli gladly accepted it, and it was
performed at La Scala in the spring of 1842. As a result
Verdi was besieged with petitions for new works from
every impresario in Italy.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>From 1842 to 1851 Verdi&rsquo;s busy imagination produced
a series of operas, which disputed the palm of popularity
with the foremost composers of his time. &ldquo;I Lombardi,&rdquo;
brought out at La Scala in 1843; &ldquo;Ernani,&rdquo; at Venice in
1844; &ldquo;I Due Foscari,&rdquo; at Rome in 1844; &ldquo;Giovanna
D&rsquo;Arco,&rdquo; at Milan, and &ldquo;Alzira,&rdquo; at Naples in 1845;
&ldquo;Attila,&rdquo; at Venice in 1846; and &ldquo;Macbetto,&rdquo; at Florence
in 1847, were&mdash;all of them&mdash;successful works. The last
created such a genuine enthusiasm that he was crowned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
with a golden laurel-wreath and escorted home from the
theatre by an enormous crowd. &ldquo;I Masnadieri&rdquo; was
written for Jenny Lind, and performed first in London in
1847 with that great singer, Gardoni, and Lablache, in the
cast. His next productions were &ldquo;Il Corsaro,&rdquo; brought
out at Trieste in 1848; &ldquo;La Battaglia di Legnano&rdquo; at
Rome in 1849; &ldquo;Luisa Miller&rdquo; at Naples in the same
year; and &ldquo;Stiffelio&rdquo; at Trieste in 1850. By this series
of works Verdi impressed himself powerfully on his age,
but in them he preserved faithfully the colour and style of
the school in which he had been trained. But he had now
arrived at the commencement of his transition period. A
distinguished French critic marks this change in the following
summary:&mdash;&ldquo;When Verdi began to write, the influences
of foreign literature and new theories on art had excited
Italian composers to seek a violent expression of the
passions, and to leave the interpretation of amiable and
delicate sentiments for that of sombre flights of the soul.
A serious mind gifted with a rich imagination, Verdi
became chief of the new school. His music became more
intense and dramatic; by vigour, energy, <i>verve</i>, a certain
ruggedness and sharpness, by powerful effects of sound, he
conquered an immense popularity in Italy, where success
had hitherto been attained only by the charm, suavity, and
abundance of the melodies produced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In &ldquo;Rigoletto,&rdquo; produced in Venice in 1851, the full
flowering of his genius into the melodramatic style was
signally shown. The opera story adapted from Victor
Hugo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Le Roi s&rsquo;amuse&rdquo; is itself one of the most dramatic
of plots, and it seemed to have fired the composer into
music singularly vigorous, full of startling effects and novel
treatment. Two years afterwards were brought out at
Rome and Venice respectively two operas, stamped with
the same salient qualities, &ldquo;Il Trovatore&rdquo; and &ldquo;La
Traviata,&rdquo; the last a lyric adaptation of Dumas <i>fils&rsquo;s</i>
&ldquo;Dame aux Cam&eacute;lias.&rdquo; These three operas have generally
been considered his masterpieces, though it is more than
possible that the riper judgment of the future will not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
sustain this claim. Their popularity was such that Verdi&rsquo;s
time was absorbed for several years in their production at
various opera-houses, utterly precluding new compositions.
Of his later operas may be mentioned &ldquo;Les V&ecirc;pres
Siciliennes,&rdquo; produced in Paris in 1855; &ldquo;Un Ballo in
Maschera,&rdquo; performed at Rome in 1859; &ldquo;La Forza del
Destino,&rdquo; written for St. Petersburg, where it was sung in
1863; &ldquo;Don Carlos,&rdquo; produced in London in 1867; and
&ldquo;Aida&rdquo; in Grand Cairo in 1872. When the latter work
was finished, Verdi had composed twenty-nine operas,
besides lesser works, and attained the aged of fifty-seven.</p>

<p>Verdi&rsquo;s energies have not been confined to music. An
ardent patriot, he has displayed the deepest interest in
the affairs of his country, and taken an active part in
its tangled politics. After the war of 1859 he was chosen a
member of the Assembly of Parma, and was one of the
most influential advocates for the annexation to Sardinia.
Italian unity found in him a passionate advocate, and,
when the occasion came, his artistic talent and earnestness
proved that they might have made a vigorous mark in
political oratory as well as in music.</p>

<p>The cry of &ldquo;Viva Verdi&rdquo; often resounded through
Sardinia and Italy, and it was one of the war-slogans of the
Italian war of liberation. This enigma is explained in the
fact that the five letters of his name are the initials of
those of Vittorio Emanuele R&egrave; D&rsquo;Italia. His private
resources were liberally poured forth to help the national
cause, and in 1861 he was chosen a deputy in Parliament
from Parma. Ten years later he was appointed by the
Minister of Public Instruction to superintend the reorganisation
of the National Musical Institute.</p>

<p>The many decorations and titular distinctions lavished
on him show the high esteem in which he is held. He is a
member of the Legion of Honour, corresponding member of
the French Academy of Fine Arts, grand cross of the
Prussian order of St. Stanislaus, of the order of the Crown
of Italy, and of the Egyptian order of Osmanli. He
divides his life between a beautiful residence at Genoa,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
where he overlooks the waters of the sparkling Mediterranean,
and a country villa near his native Busseto, a house
of quaint artistic architecture, approached by a venerable,
moss-grown stone bridge, at the foot of which are a large
park and artificial lake. When he takes his evening walks,
the peasantry, who are devotedly attached to him, unite in
singing choruses from his operas.</p>

<p>In Verdi&rsquo;s bedroom, where alone he composes, is a fine
piano&mdash;of which instrument, as well as of the violin, he
is a master&mdash;a modest library, and an oddly-shaped writing-desk.
Pictures and statuettes, of which he is very fond,
are thickly strewn about the whole house. Verdi is a
man of vigorous and active habits, taking an ardent
interest in agriculture. But the larger part of his time
is taken up in composing, writing letters, and reading
works on philosophy, politics, and history. His personal
appearance is very distinguished. A tall figure with sturdy
limbs and square shoulders, surmounted by a finely-shaped
head; abundant hair, beard, and moustache, whose black is
sprinkled with grey; dark-grey eyes, regular features, and
an earnest, sometimes intense, expression make him a
noticeable-looking man. Much sought after in the brilliant
society of Florence, Rome, and Paris, our composer spends
most of his time in the elegant seclusion of home.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Verdi is the most nervous, theatric, sensuous composer
of the present century. Measured by the highest standard,
his style must be criticised as often spasmodic, tawdry, and
meretricious. He instinctively adopts a bold and eccentric
treatment of musical themes; and, though there are always
to be found stirring movements in his scores as well as in
his opera stories, he constantly offends refined taste by
sensation and violence.</p>

<p>With a redundancy of melody, too often of the cheap
and shallow kind, he rarely fails to please the masses of
opera-goers, for his works enjoy a popularity not shared at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
present by any other composer. In Verdi a sudden blaze
of song, brief spirited airs, duets, trios, etc., take the place
of the elaborate and beautiful music, chiselled into order
and symmetry, which characterises most of the great composers
of the past. Energy of immediate impression is
thus gained at the expense of that deep, lingering power,
full of the subtile side-lights and shadows of suggestion,
which is the crowning benison of great music. He stuns
the ear and captivates the senses, but does not subdue the
soul.</p>

<p>Yet, despite the grievous faults of these operas, they
blaze with gems, and we catch here and there true swallow-flights
of genius, that the noblest would not disown. With
all his puerilities there is a mixture of grandeur. There
are passages in &ldquo;Ernani,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rigoletto,&rdquo; &ldquo;Traviata,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Trovatore,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Aida,&rdquo; so strong and dignified, that
it provokes a wonder that one with such capacity for
greatness should often descend into such bathos.</p>

<p>To better illustrate the false art which mars so much
of Verdi&rsquo;s dramatic method, a comparison between his
&ldquo;Rigoletto,&rdquo; so often claimed as his best work, and Rossini&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Otello&rdquo; will be opportune. The air sung by Gilda
in the &ldquo;Rigoletto,&rdquo; when she retires to sleep on the eve of
the outrage, is an empty, sentimental yawn; and in the
quartet of the last act, a noble dramatic opportunity, she
ejects a chain of disconnected, unmusical sobs, as offensive
as Violetta&rsquo;s consumptive cough. Desdemona&rsquo;s agitated
air, on the other hand, under Rossini&rsquo;s treatment, though
broken short in the vocal phrase, is magnificently sustained
by the orchestra, and a genuine passion is made consistently
musical; and then the wonderful burst of
bravura, where despair and resolution run riot without
violating the bounds of strict beauty in music&mdash;these are
master-strokes of genius restrained by art.</p>

<p>In Verdi, passion too often misses intensity and becomes
hysterical. He lacks the elements of tenderness and
humour, but is frequently picturesque and charming by his
warmth and boldness of colour. His attempts to express
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
the gay and mirthful, as for instance in the masquerade
music of &ldquo;Traviata&rdquo; and the dance music of &ldquo;Rigoletto,&rdquo;
are dreary, ghastly, and saddening; while his ideas of
tenderness are apt to take the form of mere sentimentality.
Yet generalities fail in describing him, for occasionally he
attains effects strong in their pathos, and artistically
admirable; as, for example, the slow air for the heroine,
and the dreamy song for the gipsy mother in the last act
of &ldquo;Trovatore.&rdquo; An artist who thus contradicts himself is
a perplexing problem, but we must judge him by the
habitual, not the occasional.</p>

<p>Verdi is always thoroughly in earnest, never frivolous.
He walks on stilts indeed, instead of treading the ground
or cleaving the air, but is never timid or tame in aim or
execution. If he cannot stir the emotions of the soul he
subdues and absorbs the attention against even the dictates
of the better taste; while genuine beauties gleaming
through picturesque rubbish often repay the true musician
for what he has undergone.</p>

<p>So far this composer has been essentially representative
of melodramatic music, with all the faults and virtues of
such a style. In &ldquo;Aida,&rdquo; his last work, the world remarked
a striking change. The noble orchestration, the
power and beauty of the choruses, the sustained dignity of
treatment, the seriousness and pathos of the whole work,
reveal how deeply new purposes and methods have been
fermenting in the composer&rsquo;s development. Yet in the
very prime of his powers, though no longer young, his next
work ought to settle the value of the hopes raised by the
last.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Note by the Editor.</span>&mdash;In 1874 Verdi composed his &ldquo;Requiem
Mass.&rdquo; It is written in a popular style, and received unanimous praise
from the Italian critics, and as thorough condemnation from those
of Germany, in particular from Herr Hans von B&uuml;low, the celebrated
pianist. It was chance which induced the composer to attempt sacred
music. On the death of Rossini, Verdi suggested that a &ldquo;Requiem&rdquo;
should be written in memory of the dead master, by thirteen Italian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
composers in combination, and that the mass should be performed on
every hundredth anniversary of the death in the cathedral of Bologna.
The attempt naturally proved a complete failure, owing to the impossibility
of unity in the method of such a composition. On the death,
however, of Alessandro Manzoni at Milan, Verdi wrote for the anniversary
of the great man&rsquo;s death a Requiem, into which he incorporated
the movement <i>Libera me</i> which he had previously written for the
Rossini Requiem.</p>

<p>In 1881 &ldquo;Simon Boccanegra&rdquo; was performed at Milan, with very
partial success. It was a revival of an opera Verdi had written ten
years previously, but which had failed owing to a confused libretto
and a bad interpretation. It, however, in its present form, falls
short in merit when compared with the composer&rsquo;s finest operas&mdash;&ldquo;Rigoletto,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Il Trovatore,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Aida.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verdi&rsquo;s last work, &ldquo;Otello,&rdquo; has been brought out since this
volume went to press; its brilliant success at the theatre of La Scala,
Milan, on the 5th of February, is a matter of such recent date that it
is unnecessary to enlarge upon it at present. Verdi has accepted an
invitation from the managers of the Grand Opera at Paris to produce
&ldquo;Otello&rdquo; at their theatre in the course of the year; the libretto will
be translated by M. du Loche, and a ballet will be introduced in the
second act, according to the traditions of the French opera. In all
probability it will also be performed in London, but as yet no public
intimation on the subject has been made.</p>

<p>It is of course impossible at present for any definite decision to be
pronounced on the merits of this latest work compared with the composer&rsquo;s
other operas; the few following facts, however, concerning
&ldquo;Otello,&rdquo; excerpted from the reports of the musical critics of our
leading journals, may prove of interest.</p>

<p>Verdi was first induced to undertake the composition of &ldquo;Otello&rdquo;
on the occasion of the performance of his &ldquo;Messa da Requiem,&rdquo; at
the Scala, for the benefit of the sufferers by the inundations at Ferrara.
The next day he gave a dinner to the four principal solo singers, at
which were present several friends, among them Signor Faccio and
Signor Ricordi. The latter laid siege to the <i>maestro</i>, trying to
persuade him to undertake a new work. For a long time Verdi
resisted, and his wife declared that probably only a Shakespearian
subject could induce him to take up his pen again. A few hours
later Faccio and Ricordi went to Bo&iuml;to, who at once agreed to make
the third in the generous conspiracy, and two days after sent to
Verdi a complete sketch of the plan for the opera, following strictly
the Shakespearian tragedy. Verdi approved of the sketch, and from
that moment it fell to the part of Giulia Ricordi to urge on the
composer and the poet by constant reminders. Every Christmas he
sent to Verdi&rsquo;s house an &ldquo;Othello&rdquo; formed of chocolate, which, at first
very small, grew larger as the opera progressed.</p>

<p>Rossini&rsquo;s famous opera on the same subject, in which Pasta and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
Malibran won renown in their day, was produced in Naples in the
autumn of 1816. How it impressed Lord Byron, who saw it in
Venice soon afterwards, we learn from an amusing postscript to his
letter to Samuel Rogers, wherein he says:&mdash;&ldquo;They have been crucifying
&lsquo;Othello&rsquo; into an opera; the music good but lugubrious; but as
for the words&mdash;all the real scenes with Iago cut out and the greatest
nonsense instead. The handkerchief turned into a billet-doux, and
the first singer would not black his face, for some exquisite reason
assigned in the preface.&rdquo; In this curiously maimed and mangled
version, Roderigo became of far more importance than the Moor&rsquo;s
crafty lieutenant. Odder still was the modified French version
played in 1823, when the leading tenor, David, thinking the final
duet with Desdemona unsuited to his voice, substituted the soft and
pretty duet, &ldquo;Amor, possente nume,&rdquo; from Rossini&rsquo;s later opera
&ldquo;Armida.&rdquo; A contemporary French critic, who witnessed this
curious performance, observes&mdash;&ldquo;As it was impossible to kill Desdemona
to such a tune, the Moor, after giving way to the most violent
jealousy, sheathed his dagger, and began the duet in the most tender
and graceful manner; after which he took Desdemona politely by the
hand and retired, amidst the applause and bravos of the public, who
seemed to think it quite natural that the piece should finish in this
fashion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verdi, with that healthy horror of tiring the public which has
always distinguished him, declined Signor Bo&iuml;to&rsquo;s proposal to treat
the subject in five acts; and, Shakespeare&rsquo;s introductory act being
discarded, the first act of the opera corresponds with the second act of
the tragedy. After that the musical drama marches scene by scene,
and situation by situation, on parallel lines with the play, with this
important exception only&mdash;namely, that the &ldquo;Willow Song,&rdquo; as in
Rossini&rsquo;s opera, is transferred from the last act but one to the last act.
There are no symphonic pieces in &ldquo;Otello,&rdquo; unless the brief
orchestral presentation of the &ldquo;Willow Song&rdquo; before the fourth act
can be so considered. The work is a drama set to music, in which
there are no repetitions, no detached or detachable airs written
specially for the singers, no passages of display, nothing whatever in
the way of music but what is absolutely necessary for the elucidation
of the piece. The influence of Wagner is perceptible here and there,
but there are no leading motives, and the general style is that of Verdi
at his best, as in &ldquo;Aida.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;It is well for the Italians that, in hailing Verdi as a great man of
genius, they are not honouring one who moves the profane world to
compassion, scarcely distinguished from contempt, by weakness of
character. His work is so good throughout, so full of method, so
complete, because his nature is complete and his life methodical; for
the same reason, no doubt, he has preserved to a ripe old age all the
essential qualities of the genius of his manhood. The leaves that
remain on the Autumnal trees are yet green, and the birds still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
sing among them. &lsquo;Otello&rsquo; itself will, in some form or other,
soon be heard in London; and it is pleasant to think that the
subject is taken from one of the greatest works of the greatest of
all literary Englishmen. The theme is noble, and so, apparently,
is the treatment. Nor should we forget that so distinguished
a composer as Signor Bo&iuml;to has not disdained, nay, has elected, to
compose the libretto for the old <i>maestro</i>. That is a form and sample
of co-operation we can all admire. Will Italy One and Free continue
to produce great and original musicians? Verdi is the product of
other and more melancholy times. Be that as it may, better national
freedom, civil activity, and personal dignity, than all the operas that
were ever written.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="cherubini" id="cherubini"></a><i>CHERUBINI AND HIS PREDECESSORS.</i></h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> France, as in Italy, the regular musical drama was preceded
by mysteries, masks, and religious plays, which
introduced short musical parts, as also action, mechanical
effects, and dancing. The ballet, however, where dancing
was the prominent feature, remained for a long time the
favourite amusement of the French court until the advent
of Jean Baptiste Lulli. The young Florentine, after having
served in the king&rsquo;s band, was promoted to be its chief, and
the composer of the music of the court ballets. Lulli, born
in 1633, was bought of his parents by Chevalier de Guise,
and sent to Paris as a present to Mdlle. de Montpensier, the
king&rsquo;s niece. His capricious mistress, after a year or two,
deposed the boy of fifteen from the position of page to that
of scullion; but Count Nogent, accidentally hearing him
sing and struck by his musical talent, influenced the
princess to place him under the care of good masters.
Lulli made such rapid progress that he soon commenced to
compose music of a style superior to that before current in
divertisements of the French court.</p>

<p>The name of Philippe Quinault is closely associated with
the musical career of Lulli; for to the poet the musician
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
was indebted for his best librettos. Born at Paris in 1636,
Quinault&rsquo;s genius for poetry displayed itself at an early age.
Before he was twenty he had written several successful
comedies. Though he produced many plays, both tragedies
and comedies, well known to readers of French poetry, his
operatic poems are those which have rendered his memory
illustrious. He died on November 29, 1688. It is said
that during his last illness he was extremely penitent on
account of the voluptuous tendency of his works. All his
lyrical dramas are full of beauty, but &ldquo;Atys,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pha&euml;ton,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Isis,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Armide&rdquo; have been ranked the highest.
&ldquo;Armide&rdquo; was the last of the poet&rsquo;s efforts, and Lulli was
so much in love with the opera, when completed, that he
had it performed over and over again for his own pleasure
without any other auditor. When &ldquo;Atys&rdquo; was performed
first in 1676, the eager throng began to pour in the theatre
at ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and by noon the building was
filled. The King and the Count were charmed with the
work in spite of the bitter dislike of Boileau, the Aristarchus
of his age. &ldquo;Put me in a place where I shall not be able
to hear the words,&rdquo; said the latter to the box-keeper; &ldquo;I like
Lulli&rsquo;s music very much, but have a sovereign contempt
for Quinault&rsquo;s words.&rdquo; Lulli obliged the poet to write
&ldquo;Armide&rdquo; five times over, and the felicity of his treatment
is proved by the fact that Gluck afterwards set the
same poem to the music which is still occasionally sung in
Germany.</p>

<p>Lulli in the course of his musical career became so great
a favourite with the King that the originally obscure
kitchen-boy was ennobled. He was made one of the King&rsquo;s
secretaries in spite of the loud murmurs of this pampered
fraternity against receiving into their body a player and a
buffoon. The musician&rsquo;s wit and affability, however, finally
dissipated these prejudices, especially as he was wealthy and
of irreproachable character.</p>

<p>The King having had a severe illness in 1686, Lulli
composed a &ldquo;Te Deum&rdquo; in honour of his recovery. When
this was given, the musician, in beating time with great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
ardour, struck his toe with his baton. This brought on a
mortification, and there was great grief when it was
announced that he could not recover. The Princes de
Vend&ocirc;me lodged four thousand pistoles in the hands of a
banker, to be paid to any physician who would cure him.
Shortly before his death his confessor severely reproached
him for the licentiousness of his operas, and refused to give
him absolution unless he consented to burn the score of
&ldquo;Achille et Polyx&egrave;ne,&rdquo; which was ready for the stage. The
manuscript was put into the flames, and the priest made the
musician&rsquo;s peace with God. One of the young princes
visited him a few days after, when he seemed a little
better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, Baptiste,&rdquo; the former said, &ldquo;have you burned
your opera? You were a fool for giving such credit to a
gloomy confessor and burning good music.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush!&rdquo; whispered Lulli, with a satirical smile
on his lip. &ldquo;I cheated the good father. I only burned a
copy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He died singing the words, &ldquo;<i>Il faut mourir, p&eacute;cheur, il
faut mourir</i>,&rdquo; to one of his own opera airs.</p>

<p>Lulli was not only a composer, but created his own
orchestra, trained his artists in acting and singing, and was
machinist as well as ballet-master and music-director. He
was intimate with Corneille, Moli&egrave;re, La Fontaine, and
Boileau; and these great men were proud to contribute the
texts to which he set his music. He introduced female
dancers into the ballet, disguised men having hitherto
served in this capacity, and in many essential ways was the
father of early French opera, though its foundation had
been laid by Cardinal Mazarin. He had to fight against
opposition and cabals, but his energy, tact, and persistence
made him the victor, and won the friendship of the leading
men of his time. Such of his music as still exists is of a
pleasing and melodious character, full of vivacity and fire,
and at times indicates a more deep and serious power than
that of merely creating catching and tuneful airs. He was
the inventor of the operatic overture, and introduced several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
new instruments into the orchestra. Apart from his
splendid administrative faculty, he is entitled to rank as an
original and gifted, if not a great composer.</p>

<p>A lively sketch of the French opera of this period is
given by Addison in No. 29 of the <i>Spectator</i>. &ldquo;The music
of the French,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is indeed very properly adapted
to their pronunciation and accent, as their whole opera
wonderfully favours the genius of such a gay, airy people.
The chorus in which that opera abounds gives the parterre
frequent opportunities of joining in concert with the stage.
This inclination of the audience to sing along with the
actors so prevails with them that I have sometimes known
the performer on the stage to do no more in a celebrated
song than the clerk of a parish church, who serves only to
raise the psalm, and is afterwards drowned in the music of
the congregation. Every actor that comes on the stage is a
beau. The queens and heroines are so painted that they
appear as ruddy and cherry-cheeked as milkmaids. The
shepherds are all embroidered, and acquit themselves in a
ball better than our English dancing-masters. I have seen
a couple of rivers appear in red stockings; and Alpheus,
instead of having his head covered with sedge and bulrushes,
making love in a fair, full-bottomed periwig, and a plume of
feathers; but with a voice so full of shakes and quavers,
that I should have thought the murmur of a country brook
the much more agreeable music. I remember the last opera
I saw in that merry nation was the &lsquo;Rape of Proserpine,&rsquo;
where Pluto, to make the more tempting figure, puts
himself in a French equipage, and brings Ascalaphus along
with him as his <i>valet de chambre</i>. This is what we call
folly and impertinence, but what the French look upon as
gay and polite.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The French musical drama continued without much
change in the hands of the Lulli school (for the musician
had several skilful imitators and successors) till the appearance
of Jean Philippe Rameau, who inaugurated a new era.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
This celebrated man was born in Auvergne in 1683, and
was during his earlier life the organist of the Clermont
cathedral church. Here he pursued the scientific researches
in music which entitled him in the eyes of his admirers to
be called the Newton of his art. He had reached the age
of fifty without recognition as a dramatic composer, when
the production of &ldquo;Hippolyte et Aricie&rdquo; excited a violent
feud by creating a strong current of opposition to the music
of Lulli. He produced works in rapid succession, and
finally overcame all obstacles, and won for himself the name
of being the greatest lyric composer which France up to
that time had produced. His last opera, &ldquo;Les Paladins,&rdquo;
was given in 1760, the composer being then seventy-seven.</p>

<p>The bitterness of the art-feuds of that day, afterwards
shown in the Gluck-Piccini contest, was foreshadowed in
that waged by Rameau against Lulli, and finally against
the Italian new-comers, who sought to take possession of
the French stage. The matter became a national quarrel,
and it was considered an insult to France to prefer the
music of an Italian to that of a Frenchman&mdash;an insult
which was often settled by the rapier point, when tongue
and pen had failed as arbitrators. The subject was keenly
debated by journalists and pamphleteers, and the press
groaned with essays to prove that Rameau was the first
musician in Europe, though his works were utterly unknown
outside of France. Perhaps no more valuable testimony to
the character of these operas can be adduced than that of
Baron Grimm:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In his operas Rameau has overpowered all his predecessors
by dint of harmony and quantity of notes. Some
of his choruses are very fine. Lulli could only sustain his
vocal psalmody by a simple bass; Rameau accompanied
almost all his recitatives with the orchestra. These accompaniments
are generally in bad taste; they drown the voice
rather than support it, and force the singers to scream and
howl in a manner which no ear of any delicacy can tolerate.
We come away from an opera of Rameau&rsquo;s intoxicated
with harmony and stupified with the noise of voice and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
instruments. His taste is always Gothic, and, whether his
subject is light or forcible, his style is equally heavy. He
was not destitute of ideas, but did not know what use to
make of them. In his recitatives the sound is continually
in opposition to the sense, though they occasionally contain
happy declamatory passages.... If he had formed himself
in some of the schools of Italy, and thus acquired a notion
of musical style and habits of musical thought, he never
would have said (as he did) that all poems were alike to
him, and that he could set the <i>Gazette de France</i> to
music.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From this it may be gathered that Rameau, though a
scientific and learned musician, lacked imagination, good
taste, and dramatic insight&mdash;qualities which in the modern
lyric school of France have been so pre-eminent. It may be
admitted, however, that he inspired a taste for sound
musical science, and thus prepared the way for the great
Gluck, who to all and more of Rameau&rsquo;s musical knowledge
united the grand genius which makes him one of the giants
of his art.</p>

<p>Though Rameau enjoyed supremacy over the serious
opera, a great excitement was created in Paris by the
arrival of an Italian company, who in 1752 obtained permission
to perform Italian burlettas and intermezzi at the
opera-house. The partisans of the French school took
alarm, and the admirers of Lulli and Rameau forgot their
bickerings to join forces against the foreign intruders. The
battle-field was strewed with floods of ink, and the literati
pelted each other with ferocious lampoons.</p>

<p>Among the literature of this controversy, one pamphlet
has an imperishable place, Rousseau&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;Lettre sur
la Musique Fran&ccedil;aise,&rdquo; in which the great sentimentalist
espoused the cause of Italian music with an eloquence and
acrimony rarely surpassed. The inconsistency of the
author was as marked in this as in his private life. Not
only did he at a later period become a great advocate of
Gluck against Piccini, but, in spite of his argument that it
was impossible to compose music to French words, that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
language was quite unfit for it, that the French never had
music and never would, he himself had composed a good
deal of music to French words and produced a French
opera, &ldquo;Le Devin du Village.&rdquo; Diderot was also a warm
partisan of the Italians. Pergolesi&rsquo;s beautiful music having
been murdered by the French orchestra-players at the
Grand Opera-House, Diderot proposed for it the following
witty and laconic inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;Hic Marsyas Apollinem.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a></p>

<p>Rousseau&rsquo;s opera, &ldquo;Le Devin du Village,&rdquo; was performed
with considerable success, in spite of the repugnance of the
orchestral performers, of whom Rousseau always spoke in
terms of unmeasured contempt, to do justice to the music.
They burned Rousseau in effigy for his scoffs. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
said the author of the <i>Confessions</i>, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder that
they should hang me now, after having so long put me to
the torture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eloquence and abuse of the wits, however, did not
long impair the supremacy of Rameau; for the Italian company
returned to their own land, disheartened by their
reception in the French capital. Though this composer
commenced so late in life, he left thirty-six dramatic works.
His greatest work was &ldquo;Castor et Pollux.&rdquo; Thirty years
later Grimm recognised its merits by admitting, in spite of
the great faults of the composer, &ldquo;It is the pivot on which
the glory of French music turns.&rdquo; When Louis XIV.
offered Rameau a title, he answered, touching his breast
and forehead, &ldquo;My nobility is here and here.&rdquo; This composer
marked a step forward in French music, for he gave
it more boldness and freedom, and was the first really
scientific and well-equipped exponent of a national school.
His choruses were full of energy and fire, his orchestral
effects rich and massive. He died in 1764, and the
mortuary music, composed by himself, was performed by a
double orchestra and chorus from the Grand Opera.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>A distinguished place in the records of French music
must be assigned to <span class="smcap">Andr&eacute; Ernest Gr&eacute;try</span>, born at Li&eacute;ge
in 1741. His career covered the most important changes
in the art as coloured and influenced by national tastes,
and he is justly regarded as the father of comic opera in his
adopted country. His childish life is one of much severe
discipline and tribulation, for he was dedicated to music by
his father, who was first violinist in the college of St. Denis,
when he was only six years old. He afterwards wrote of
this time in his <i>Essais sur la Musique</i>&mdash;&ldquo;The hour for
the lesson afforded the teacher an opportunity to exercise
his cruelty. He made us sing each in turn, and woe to
him who made the least mistake; he was beaten unmercifully,
the youngest as well as the oldest. He seemed to
take pleasure in inventing torture. At times he would
place us on a short round stick, from which we fell head
over heels if we made the least movement. But that which
made us tremble with fear was to see him knock down a
pupil and beat him; for then we were sure he would treat
some others in the same manner, one victim being insufficient
to gratify his ferocity. To maltreat his pupils was a
sort of mania with him; and he seemed to feel that his
duty was performed in proportion to the cries and sobs
which he drew forth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1759 Gr&eacute;try went to Rome, where he studied counterpoint
for five years. Some of his works were received
favourably by the Roman public, and he was made a
member of the Philharmonic Society of Bologna. Pressed
by pecuniary necessity, Gr&eacute;try determined to go to Paris;
but he stopped at Geneva on the route to earn money by
singing-lessons. Here he met Voltaire at Ferney. &ldquo;You
are a musician and have genius,&rdquo; said the great man; &ldquo;it
is a very rare thing, and I take much interest in you.&rdquo;
In spite of this, however, Voltaire would not write him the
text for an opera. The philosopher of Ferney feared to
trust his reputation with an unknown musician. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
Gr&eacute;try arrived in Paris he still found the same difficulty, as
no distinguished poet was disposed to give him a libretto
till he had made his powers recognised. After two years
of starving and waiting, Marmontel gave him the text
of &ldquo;The Huron,&rdquo; which was brought out in 1769 and
well received. Other successful works followed in rapid
succession.</p>

<p>At this time Parisian frivolity thought it good taste
to admire the rustic and na&iuml;ve. The idyls of Gessner and
the pastorals of Florian were the favourite reading, and
Watteau the popular painter. Gentlefolks, steeped in
artifice, vice, and intrigue, masked their empty lives under
the assumption of Arcadian simplicity, and minced and
ambled in the costumes of shepherds and shepherdesses.
Marie Antoinette transformed her chalet of Petit Trianon
into a farm, where she and her courtiers played at pastoral
life&mdash;the farce preceding the tragedy of the Revolution.
It was the effort of dazed society seeking change. Gr&eacute;try
followed the fashionable bent by composing pastoral
comedies, and mounted on the wave of success.</p>

<p>In 1774 &ldquo;Fausse Magie&rdquo; was produced with the greatest
applause. Rousseau was present, and the composer waited
on him in his box, meeting a most cordial reception. On
their way home after the opera, Gr&eacute;try offered his new
friend his arm to help him over an obstruction. Rousseau
with a burst of rage said, &ldquo;Let me make use of my own
powers,&rdquo; and henceforward the sentimental misanthrope
refused to recognise the composer. About this time
Gr&eacute;try met the English humorist Hales, who afterwards
furnished him with many of his comic texts. The two
combined to produce the &ldquo;Jugement de Midas,&rdquo; a satire
on the old style of music, which met with remarkable
popular favour, though it was not so well received by the
court.</p>

<p>The crowning work of this composer&rsquo;s life was given to
the world in 1785. This was &ldquo;Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion,&rdquo;
and it proved one of the great musical events of the period.
Paris was in ecstasies, and the judgment of succeeding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
generations has confirmed the contemporary verdict, as it
is still a favourite opera in France and Germany. The
works afterwards composed by Gr&eacute;try showed decadence in
power. Singularly rich in fresh and sprightly ideas, he
lacked depth and grandeur, and failed to suit the deeper
and sounder taste which Cherubini and M&eacute;hul, great followers
in the footsteps of Gluck, gratified by a series of
noble masterpieces. Gr&eacute;try&rsquo;s services to his art, however,
by his production of comic operas full of lyric vivacity and
sparkle, have never been forgotten nor underrated. His
bust was placed in the opera-house during his lifetime, and
he was made a member of the French Academy of Fine Arts
and Inspector of the Conservatory. Gr&eacute;try possessed qualities
of heart which endeared him to all, and his death in 1813
was the occasion of a general outburst of lamentation.
Deputations from the theatres and the Conservatory accompanied
his remains to the cemetery, where M&eacute;hul pronounced
an eloquent eulogium. In 1828 a nephew of
Gr&eacute;try caused the heart of him who was one of the glorious
sons of Li&eacute;ge to be returned to his native city.</p>

<p>Gr&eacute;try founded a school of musical composition in France
which has since been cultivated with signal success&mdash;that of
lyric comedy. The efforts of Lulli and Rameau had been
turned in another direction. The former had done little
more than set courtly pageants to music, though he had
done this with great skill and tact, enriching them with a
variety of concerted and orchestral pieces, and showing
much fertility in the invention alike of pathetic and lively
melodies. Rameau followed in the footsteps of Lulli, but
expanded and crystallised his ideas into a more scientific
form. He had indeed carried his love of form to a radical
extreme. Jean Jacques Rousseau, who extended his taste
for nature and simplicity to music, blamed him severely as
one who neglected genuine natural tune for far-fetched harmonies,
on the ground that &ldquo;music is a child of nature,
and has a language of its own for expressing emotional
transports, which cannot be learned from thorough-bass
rules.&rdquo; Again, Rousseau, in his forcible tract on French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
music, says of Rameau, from whose school Gr&eacute;try&rsquo;s music
was such a significant departure&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One must confess that M. Rameau possesses very great
talent, much fire and euphony, and a considerable knowledge
of harmonious combinations and effects; one must
also grant him the art of appropriating the ideas of others
by changing their character, adorning and developing them,
and turning them around in all manner of ways. On the
other hand, he shows less facility in inventing new ones.
Altogether he has more skill than fertility, more knowledge
than genius, or rather genius smothered by knowledge, but
always force, grace, and very often a beautiful <i>cantilena</i>.
His recitative is not as natural but much more varied than
that of Lulli; admirable in a few scenes, but bad as a
rule.&rdquo; Rousseau continues to reproach Rameau with a too
powerful instrumentation, compared with Italian simplicity,
and sums up that nobody knew better than Rameau how
to conceive the spirit of single passages and to produce
artistic contrasts, but that he entirely failed to give his
operas &ldquo;a happy and much-to-be-desired unity.&rdquo; In another
part of the quoted passage Rousseau says that Rameau
stands far beneath Lulli in <i>esprit</i> and artistic tact, but that
he is often superior to him in dramatic expression.</p>

<p>A clear understanding of the musical position of Rameau
is necessary to fully appreciate the place of Gr&eacute;try, his
antithesis as a composer. For a short time the popularity
of Rameau had been shaken by an Italian opera company,
called by the French <i>Les Bouffons</i>, who had created a
genuine sensation by their performance of airy and sparkling
operettas, entirely removed in spirit from the ponderous
productions of the prevailing school. Though the Italian
comedians did not meet with permanent success, the suave
charm of their music left behind it memories which
became fruitful.<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> It furnished the point of departure for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>237]</a></span>
the lively and facile genius of Gr&eacute;try, who laid the foundation
stones for that lyric comedy which has flourished in
France with so much luxuriance. From the outset merriment
and humour were by no means the sole object of the
French comic opera, as in the case of its Italian sister.
Gr&eacute;try did not neglect to turn the nobler emotions to
account, and by a judicious admixture of sentiment he gave
an ideal colouring to his works, which made them singularly
fascinating and original. Around Gr&eacute;try flourished several
disciples and imitators, and for twenty years this charming
hybrid between opera and vaudeville engrossed French
musical talent, to the exclusion of other forms of composition.
It was only when Gluck<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> appeared on the scene,
and by his commanding genius restored serious opera to its
supremacy, that Gr&eacute;try&rsquo;s repute was overshadowed. From
this decline in public favour he never fully recovered, for
the master left behind him gifted disciples, who embodied
his traditions, and were inspired by his lofty aims&mdash;pre-eminently
so in the case of Cherubini, perhaps the greatest
name in French music. While French comic opera, since
the days of Gr&eacute;try, has become modified in some of its
forms, it preserves the spirit and colouring which he so
happily imparted to it, and looks back to him as its founder
and lawgiver.</p>

In its infancy Italian comic opera formed the <i>intermezzo</i> between
the acts of a serious opera, and&mdash;similar to the Greek sylvan drama
which followed the tragic trilogy&mdash;was frequently a parody on the
piece which preceded it; though more frequently still (as in Pergolesi&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Serva Padrona&rdquo;) it was not a satire on any particular subject,
but designed to heighten the ideal artistic effect of the serious opera by
broad comedy. Having acquired a complete form on the boards of
the small theatres, it was transferred to the larger stage. Though it
lacked the external splendour and consummate vocalisation of the
elder sister, its simpler forms endowed it with a more characteristic
rendering of actual life.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>One of the most accomplished of historians and critics,
Oulibischeff, sums up the place of Cherubini in musical art
in these words&mdash;&ldquo;If on the one hand Gluck&rsquo;s calm and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span>
plastic grandeur, and on the other the tender and voluptuous
charm of the melodies of Piccini and Zacchini, had
suited the circumstances of a state of society sunk in
luxury and nourished with classical exhibitions, this could
not satisfy a society shaken to the very foundations of its
faith and organisation. The whole of the dramatic music
of the eighteenth century must naturally have appeared
cold and languid to men whose minds were profoundly
moved with troubles and wars; and even at the present
day the word languor best expresses that which no longer
touches us in the operas of the last century, without even
excepting those of Mozart himself. What we require
for the pictures of dramatic music is larger frames, including
more figures, more passionate and moving song, more
sharply marked rhythms, greater fulness in the vocal
masses, and more sonorous brilliancy in the instrumentation.
All these qualities are to be found in &lsquo;Lodo&iuml;ska&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Les Deux Journ&eacute;es;&rsquo; and Cherubini may not only be
regarded as the founder of the modern French opera, but
also as that musician who, after Mozart, has exerted the
greatest general influence on the tendency of the art. An
Italian by birth and the excellence of his education, which
was conducted by Sarti, the great teacher of composition;
a German by his musical sympathies as well as by the
variety and profundity of his knowledge; and a Frenchman
by the school and principles to which we owe his finest
dramatic works, Cherubini strikes me as being the most
accomplished musician, if not the greatest genius, of the
nineteenth century.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again, the English composer, Macfarren, observes&mdash;&ldquo;Cherubini&rsquo;s
position is unique in the history of his art;
actively before the world as a composer for threescore
years and ten, his career spans over more vicissitudes in
the progress of music than that of any other man. Beginning
to write in the same year with Cimarosa, and even
earlier than Mozart, and being the contemporary of Verdi
and Wagner, he witnessed almost the origin of the two
modern classical schools of France and Germany, their rise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
to perfection, and, if not their decline, the arrival of a time
when criticism would usurp the place of creation, and
when to propound new rules for art claims higher consideration
than to act according to its ever unalterable
principles. His artistic life indeed was a rainbow based
on the two extremes of modern music which shed light and
glory on the great art-cycle over which it arched.... His
excellence consists in his unswerving earnestness of purpose,
in the individuality of his manner, in the vigour of his ideas,
and in the purity of his harmony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such,&rdquo; says M. Miel, &ldquo;was Cherubini; a colossal and
incommensurable genius, an existence full of days, of masterpieces,
and of glory. Among his rivals he found his
most sincere appreciators. The Chevalier Seyfried has
recorded, in a notice on Beethoven, that that grand
musician regarded Cherubini as the first of his contemporary
composers. We will add nothing to this praise:
the judgment of such a rival is, for Cherubini, the voice
itself of posterity.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luigi Carlo Zanobe Salvadore Maria Cherubini</span> was
born at Florence on September 14, 1760, the son of a harpsichord
accompanist at the Pergola Theatre. Like so many
other great composers, young Cherubini displayed signs of a
fertile and powerful genius at an early age, mastering the
difficulties of music as if by instinct. At the age of nine
he was placed under the charge of Felici, one of the best
Tuscan professors of the day; and four years afterwards he
composed his first work, a mass. His creative instinct,
thus awakened, remained active, and he produced a series
of compositions which awakened no little admiration, so
that he was pointed at in the streets of Florence as the
young prodigy. When he was about sixteen the attention
of the Grand Duke Leopold of Tuscany was directed to him,
and through that prince&rsquo;s liberality he was enabled to
become a pupil of the most celebrated Italian master of
the age, Giuseppe Sarti, of whom he soon became the
favourite pupil. Under the direction of Sarti, the young
composer produced a series of operas, sonatas, and masses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
and wrote much of the music which appeared under the
<i>maestro&rsquo;s</i> own name&mdash;a practice then common in the music
and painting schools of Italy. At the age of nineteen
Cherubini was recognised as one of the most learned and
accomplished musicians of the age, and his services were in
active demand at the Italian theatres. In four years he
produced thirteen operas, the names and character of
which it is not necessary now to mention, as they are
unknown except to the antiquary whose zeal prompts him
to defy the dust of the Italian theatrical libraries. Hal&eacute;vy,
whose admiration of his master led him to study these
early compositions, speaks of them as full of striking
beauties, and, though crude in many particulars, distinguished
by those virile and daring conceptions which
from the outset stamped the originality of the man.</p>

<p>Cherubini passed through Paris in 1784, while the Gluck-Piccini
excitement was yet warm, and visited London as
composer for the Royal Italian Opera. Here he became a
constant visitor in courtly circles, and the Prince of Wales,
the Duke of Queensbury, and other noble amateurs, conceived
the warmest admiration for his character and
abilities. For some reason, however, his operas written
for England failed, and he quitted England in 1786, intending
to return to Italy. But the fascinations of Paris held
him, as they have done so many others, noticeably so among
the great musicians; and what was designed as a flying
visit became a life-long residence, with the exception of
brief interruptions in Germany and Italy, whither he went
to fill professional engagements.</p>

<p>Cherubini took up his residence with his friend Viotti,
who introduced him to the Queen, Marie Antoinette, and
the highest society of the capital, then as now the art-centre
of the world. He became an intimate of the brilliant
salons of Mdme. de Polignac, Mdme. d&rsquo;Etioles, Mdme. de
Richelieu, and of the various bright assemblies where the
wit, rank, and beauty of Paris gathered in the days just
prior to the Revolution. The poet Marmontel became his
intimate friend, and gave him the opera story of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
&ldquo;Demophon&rdquo; to set to music. It was at this period that
Cherubini became acquainted with the works of Haydn,
and learned from him how to unite depth with lightness,
grace with power, jest with earnestness, and toying with
dignity.</p>

<p>A short visit to Italy for the carnival of 1788 resulted
in the production of the opera of &ldquo;Ifigenia in Aulide&rdquo; at
La Scala, Milan. The success was great, and this work,
the last written for his native country, was given also at
Florence and Parma with no less delight and approbation
on the part of the public. Had Cherubini died at this
time, he would have left nothing but an obscure name for
F&eacute;tis&rsquo;s immense dictionary. Unlike Mozart and Schubert,
who at the same age had reached their highest development,
this robust and massive genius ripened slowly. With him
as with Gluck, with whom he had so many affinities, a
short life would have been fatal to renown. His last opera
showed a turning point in his development. Hal&eacute;vy, his
great disciple, speaks of this period as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;He is
already more nervous; there peeps out I know not exactly
how much of force and virility of which the Italian
musicians of his day did not know or did not seek the
secret. It is the dawn of a new day. Cherubini was preparing
himself for the combat. Gluck had accustomed
France to the sublime energy of his masterpieces. Mozart
had just written &lsquo;Le Nozze di Figaro&rsquo; and &lsquo;Don Giovanni.&rsquo;
He must not lag behind. He must not be conquered. In
that career which he was about to dare to enter, he met two
giants. Like the athlete who descends into the arena, he
anointed his limbs and girded his loins for the fight.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Marmontel had furnished the libretto of an opera to
Cherubini, and the composer shortly after his return from
Turin to Paris had it produced at the Royal Academy of
Music. Vogel&rsquo;s opera on the same text, &ldquo;Demophon,&rdquo;
was also brought out, but neither one met with great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
success. Cherubini&rsquo;s work, though full of vigour and force,
wanted colour and dramatic point. He was disgusted with
his failure, and resolved to eschew dramatic music; so for
the nonce he devoted himself to instrumental music and
cantata. Two works of the latter class, &ldquo;Amphion&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Circe,&rdquo; composed at this time, were of such excellence as
to retain a permanent hold on the French stage. Cherubini,
too, became director of the Italian opera troupe, &ldquo;Les
Bouffons,&rdquo; organised under the patronage of L&eacute;onard, the
Queen&rsquo;s performer, and exercised his taste for composition
by interpolating airs of his own into the works of the
Italian composers, which were then interesting the French
public as against the operas of Rameau.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At this time,&rdquo; we are told by Lafage, &ldquo;Cherubini had
two distinct styles, one of which was allied to Paisiello and
Cimarosa by the grace, elegance, and purity of the melodic
forms; the other, which attached itself to the school of
Gluck and Mozart, more harmonic than melodious, rich in
instrumental details.&rdquo; This manner was the then unappreciated
type of a new school destined to change the forms
of musical art.</p>

<p>In 1790 the Revolution broke out and rent the established
order of things into fragments. For a time all the
interests of art were swallowed up in the frightful turmoil
which made Paris the centre of attention for astonished
and alarmed Europe. Cherubini&rsquo;s connection had been
with the aristocracy, and now they were fleeing in a mad
panic or mounting the scaffold. His livelihood became precarious,
and he suffered severely during the first five years
of anarchy. His seclusion was passed in studying music,
the physical sciences, drawing, and botany; and his acquaintance
was wisely confined to a few musicians like
himself. Once, indeed, his having learned the violin as a
child was the means of saving his life. Independently
venturing out at night, he was arrested by a roving band
of drunken <i>Sansculottes</i>, who were seeking musicians to
conduct their street chants. Somebody recognised Cherubini
as a favourite of court circles, and, when he refused to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>243]</a></span>
lead their obscene music, the fatal cry, &ldquo;The Royalist, the
Royalist!&rdquo; buzzed through the crowd. At this critical
moment another kidnapped player thrust a violin in Cherubini&rsquo;s
hands and persuaded him to yield. So the two
musicians marched all day amid the hoarse yells of the
drunken revolutionists. He was also enrolled in the
National Guard, and obliged to accompany daily the march
of the unfortunate throngs who shed their blood under the
axe of the guillotine. Cherubini would have fled from
these horrible surroundings, but it was difficult to evade
the vigilance of the French officials; he had no money;
and he would not leave the beautiful C&eacute;cile Tourette, to
whom he was affianced.</p>

<p>One of the theatres opened during the revolutionary
epoch was the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Feydeau. The second opera performed
was Cherubini&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lodo&iuml;ska&rdquo; (1791), at which he
had been labouring for a long time, and which was received
throughout Europe with the greatest enthusiasm and
delight, not less in Germany than in France and Italy.
The stirring times aroused a new taste in music, as well as
in politics and literature. The dramas of Racine and the
operas of Lulli were akin. No less did the stormy genius
of Schiller find its counterpart in Beethoven and Cherubini.
The production of &ldquo;Lodo&iuml;ska&rdquo; was the point of departure
from which the great French school of serious opera, which
has given us &ldquo;Robert le Diable,&rdquo; &ldquo;Les Huguenots,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Faust,&rdquo; got its primal value and significance. Two men
of genius, Gluck and Gr&eacute;try, had formed the tastes of the
public in being faithful to the accents of nature. The idea
of reconciling this taste, founded on strict truth, with the
seductive charm of the Italian forms, to which the French
were beginning to be sensible, suggested to Cherubini a
system of lyric drama capable of satisfying both. Wagner
himself even says, in his <i>Tendencies and Theories</i>,
speaking of Cherubini and his great co-labourers, M&eacute;hul and
Spontini&mdash;&ldquo;It would be difficult to answer them, if they
now perchance came among us and asked in what respect
we had improved on their mode of musical procedure.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244]</a></span>
&ldquo;Lodo&iuml;ska,&rdquo; which cast the old Italian operas into permanent
oblivion, and laid the foundation of the modern
French dramatic school in music, has a libretto similar to
that of &ldquo;Fidelio&rdquo; and Gr&eacute;try&rsquo;s &ldquo;C&oelig;ur de Lion&rdquo; combined,
and was taken from a romance of Faiblas by Fillette
Loraux. The critics found only one objection: the music
was all so beautiful that no breathing time was granted the
listener. In one year the opera was performed two
hundred times, and at short intervals two hundred more
representations took place.</p>

<p>The Revolution culminated in the crisis of 1793, which
sent the King to the scaffold. Cherubini found a retreat at
La Chartreuse, near Rouen, the country-seat of his friend,
the architect Louis. Here he lived in tranquillity, and
composed several minor pieces and a three-act opera, never
produced, but afterwards worked over into &ldquo;Ali Baba&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Faniska.&rdquo; In his Norman retreat Cherubini heard of the
death of his father, and while suffering under this infliction,
just before his return to Paris in 1794, he composed the
opera of &ldquo;Elisa.&rdquo; This work was received with much
favour at the Feydeau theatre, though it did not arouse the
admiration called out by &ldquo;Lodo&iuml;ska.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1795 the Paris Conservatory was founded, and
Cherubini appointed one of the five inspectors, as well as
professor of counterpoint, his associates being Lesueur,
Gr&eacute;try, Gossec, and M&eacute;hul. The same year also saw him
united to C&eacute;cile Tourette, to whom he had been so long and
devotedly attached. Absorbed in his duties at the Conservatory,
he did not come before the public again till 1797,
when the great tragic masterpiece of &ldquo;M&eacute;d&eacute;e&rdquo; was produced
at the Feydeau theatre. &ldquo;Lodo&iuml;ska&rdquo; had been
somewhat gay; &ldquo;Elisa,&rdquo; a work of graver import, followed;
but in &ldquo;M&eacute;d&eacute;e&rdquo; was sustained the profound tragic power
of Gluck and Beethoven. Hoffman&rsquo;s libretto was indeed
unworthy of the great music, but this has not prevented its
recognition by musicians as one of the noblest operas ever
written. It has probably been one of the causes, however,
why it is so rarely represented at the present time, its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>245]</a></span>
overture alone being well known to modern musical audiences.
This opera has been compared by critics to Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&ldquo;King Lear,&rdquo; as being a great expression of anguish and
despair in their more stormy phases. Chorley tells us that,
when he first saw it, he was irresistibly reminded of the
lines in Barry Cornwall&rsquo;s poem to Pasta&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Now thou art like some wing&egrave;d thing that cries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above some city, flaming fast to death.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The poem which Chorley quotes from was inspired by the
performance of the great Pasta in Simone Mayer&rsquo;s weak
musical setting of the fable of the Colchian sorceress, which
crowded the opera-houses of Europe. The life of the
French classical tragedy, too, was powerfully assisted
by Rachel. Though the poem on which Cherubini worked
was unworthy of his genius, it could not be from this or
from lack of interest in the theme alone that this great
work is so rarely performed; it is because there have been
not more than three or four actresses in the last hundred
years combining the great tragic and vocal requirements
exacted by the part. If the tragic genius of Pasta could
have been united with the voice of a Catalania, made as it
were of adamant and gold, Cherubini&rsquo;s sublime musical
creation would have found an adequate interpreter. Mdlle.
Tietjens, indeed, has been the only late dramatic singer who
dared essay so difficult a task. Musical students rank the
instrumental parts of this opera with the organ music of
Bach, the choral fugues of Handel, and the symphonies of
Beethoven, for beauty of form and originality of ideas.</p>

<p>On its first representation, on the 13th of March 1797,
one of the journals, after praising its beauty, professed to
discover imitations of M&eacute;hul&rsquo;s manner in it. The latter
composer, in an indignant rejoinder, proclaimed himself and
all others as overshadowed by Cherubini&rsquo;s genius: a singular
example of artistic humility and justice. Three years after
its performance in Paris, it was given at Berlin and Vienna,
and stamped by the Germans as one of the world&rsquo;s great
musical masterpieces. This work was a favourite one with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
Schubert, Beethoven, and Weber, and there have been few
great composers who have not put on record their admiration
of it.</p>

<p>As great, however, as &ldquo;M&eacute;d&eacute;e&rdquo; is ranked, &ldquo;Les Deux
Journ&eacute;es,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> produced in 1800, is the opera on which
Cherubini&rsquo;s fame as a dramatic composer chiefly rests. Three
hundred consecutive performances did not satisfy Paris;
and at Berlin and Frankfort, as well as in Italy, it was
hailed with acclamation. Bouilly was the author of the
opera-story, suggested by the generous action of a water-carrier
towards a magistrate who was related to the author.
The story is so interesting, so admirably written, that
Goethe and Mendelssohn considered it the true model for a
comic opera. The musical composition, too, is nearly faultless
in form and replete with beauties. In this opera
Cherubini anticipated the reforms of Wagner, for he dispensed
with the old system which made the drama a web of
beautiful melodies, and established his musical effects for
the most part by the vigour and charm of the choruses and
concerted pieces. It has been accepted as a model work by
composers, and Beethoven was in the habit of keeping it by
him on his writing-table for constant study and reference.</p>

<p>Spohr, in his autobiography, says, &ldquo;I recollect, when the
&lsquo;Deux Journ&eacute;es&rsquo; was performed for the first time, how,
intoxicated with delight and the powerful impression the
work had made on me, I asked on that very evening to
have the score given me, and sat over it the whole night;
and that it was that opera chiefly that gave me my first
impulse to composition.&rdquo; Weber, in a letter from Munich
written in 1813, says, &ldquo;Fancy my delight when I beheld
lying upon the table of the hotel the play-bill with the
magic name <i>Armand</i>. I was the first person in the theatre,
and planted myself in the middle of the pit, where I waited
most anxiously for the tones which I knew beforehand
would elevate and inspire me. I think I may assert boldly
that &lsquo;Les Deux Journ&eacute;es&rsquo; is a really great dramatic and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>247]</a></span>
classical work. Everything is calculated so as to produce
the greatest effect; all the various pieces are so much in
their proper place that you can neither omit one nor make
any addition to them. The opera displays a pleasing richness
of melody, vigorous declamation, and all-striking truth in
the treatment of situations, ever new, ever heard and
retained with pleasure.&rdquo; Mendelssohn, too, writing to his
father of a performance of this opera, speaks of the enthusiasm
of the audience as extreme, as well as of his own pleasure
as surpassing anything he had ever experienced in a theatre.
Mendelssohn, who never completed an opera, because he did
not find until shortly before his death a theme which
properly inspired him to dramatic creation, corresponded
with Planch&eacute;, with the hope of getting from the latter a
libretto which should unite the excellences of &ldquo;Fidelio&rdquo;
with those of &ldquo;Les Deux Journ&eacute;es.&rdquo; He found, at last, a
libretto, which, if it did not wholly satisfy him, at least
overcame some of his prejudices, in a story based on the
Rhine myth of Lorelei. A fragment of it only was finished,
and the finale of the first act is occasionally performed in
England.</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Before Napoleon became First Consul, he had been on
familiar terms with Cherubini. The soldier and the composer
were seated in the same box listening to an opera by
the latter. Napoleon, whose tastes for music were for the
suave and sensuous Italian style, turned to him and said,
&ldquo;My dear Cherubini, you are certainly an excellent musician;
but really your music is so noisy and complicated that I can
make nothing of it;&rdquo; to which Cherubini replied, &ldquo;My
dear general, you are certainly an excellent soldier; but in
regard to music you must excuse me if I don&rsquo;t think it
necessary to adapt my music to your comprehension.&rdquo; This
haughty reply was the beginning of an estrangement.
Another illustration of Cherubini&rsquo;s sturdy pride and dignity
was his rejoinder to Napoleon, when the latter was praising
the works of the Italian composers, and covertly sneering at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>248]</a></span>
his own. &ldquo;Citizen General,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;occupy yourself
with battles and victories, and allow me to treat according
to my talent an art of which you are grossly ignorant.&rdquo;
Even when Napoleon became Emperor, the proud composer
never learned &ldquo;to crook the pregnant hinges of his knee&rdquo;
to the man before whom Europe trembled.</p>

<p>On the 12th of December 1800, a grand performance of
&ldquo;The Creation&rdquo; took place at Paris. Napoleon on his way
to it narrowly escaped being killed by an infernal machine.
Cherubini was one of the deputation, representing the
various corporations and societies of Paris, who waited on
the First Consul to congratulate him upon his escape.
Cherubini kept in the background, when the sarcasm,
&ldquo;I do not see Monsieur Cherubini,&rdquo; pronounced in the
French way, as if to indicate that Cherubini was not
worthy of being ranked with the Italian composers,
brought him promptly forward. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Napoleon,
&ldquo;the French are in Italy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where would they not go,&rdquo;
answered Cherubini, &ldquo;led by such a hero as you?&rdquo; This
pleased the First Consul, who, however, soon got to the
old musical quarrel. &ldquo;I tell you I like Paisiello&rsquo;s music
immensely; it is soft and tranquil. You have much talent,
but there is too much accompaniment.&rdquo; Said Cherubini,
&ldquo;Citizen Consul, I conform myself to French taste.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Your music,&rdquo; continued the other, &ldquo;makes too much
noise. Speak to me in that of Paisiello; that is what lulls
me gently.&rdquo; &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; replied the composer; &ldquo;you
like music which doesn&rsquo;t stop you from thinking of state
affairs.&rdquo; This witty rejoinder made the arrogant soldier
frown, and the talk suddenly ceased.</p>

<p>As a result of this alienation Cherubini found himself
persistently ignored and ill-treated by the First Consul.
In spite of his having produced such great masterpieces,
his income was very small, apart from his pay as Inspector
of the Conservatory. The ill-will of the ruler of France
was a steady check to his preferment. When Napoleon
established his consular chapel in 1802, he invited Paisiello
from Naples to become director at a salary of 12,000 francs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>249]</a></span>
a year. It gave great umbrage to the Conservatory that
its famous teachers should have been slighted for an
Italian foreigner, and musical circles in Paris were shaken
by petty contentions. Paisiello, however, found the public
indifferent to his works, and soon wearied of a place where
the admiration to which he had been accustomed no longer
flattered his complacency. He resigned, and his position
was offered to M&eacute;hul, who is said to have declined it
because he regarded Cherubini as far more worthy of it,
and to have accepted it only on condition that his friend
could share the duties and emoluments with him.
Cherubini, fretted and irritated by his condition, retired for
a time from the pursuit of his art, and devoted himself
to flowers. The opera of &ldquo;Anacreon,&rdquo; a powerful but
unequal work, which reflected the disturbance and agitation
of his mind, was the sole fruit of his musical efforts for
about four years.</p>

<p>While Cherubini was in the deepest depression&mdash;for he
had a large family depending on him and small means with
which to support them&mdash;a ray of sunshine came in 1805 in
the shape of an invitation to compose for the managers
of the opera at Vienna. His advent at the Austrian
capital produced a profound sensation, and he received
a right royal welcome from the great musicians of Germany.
The aged Haydn, Hummel, and Beethoven became his
warm friends with the generous freemasonry of genius, for
his rank as a musician was recognised throughout Europe.</p>

<p>The war which broke out after our musician&rsquo;s departure
from Paris between France and Austria ended shortly in
the capitulation of Ulm, and the French Emperor took
up his residence at Sch&ouml;nbrunn. Napoleon received
Cherubini kindly when he came in answer to his summons,
and it was arranged that a series of twelve concerts should be
given alternately at Sch&ouml;nbrunn and Vienna. The pettiness
which entered into the French Emperor&rsquo;s nature in spite of
his greatness continued to be shown in his ebullitions of
wrath because Cherubini persisted in holding his own
musical views against the imperial opinion. Napoleon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>250]</a></span>
however, on the eve of his return to France, urged him
to accompany him, offering the long-coveted position of
musical director; but Cherubini was under contract to
remain a certain length of time at Vienna, and he would
not break his pledge.</p>

<p>The winter of 1805 witnessed two remarkable musical
events at the Austrian capital, the production of
Beethoven&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fidelio&rdquo; and the last great opera written
by Cherubini, &ldquo;Faniska.&rdquo; Haydn and Beethoven were
both present at the latter performance. The former
embraced Cherubini and said to him &ldquo;You are my son,
worthy of my love.&rdquo; Beethoven cordially hailed him as
&ldquo;the first dramatic composer of the age.&rdquo; It is an interesting
fact that two such important dramatic compositions
should have been written at the same time, independently
of each other; that both works should have been in
advance of their age; that they should have displayed
a striking similarity of style; and that both should have
suffered from the reproach of the music being too learned
for the public. The opera of &ldquo;Faniska&rdquo; is based on a
Polish legend of great dramatic beauty, which, however,
was not very artistically treated by the librettist.
Mendelssohn in after years noted the striking resemblance
between Beethoven and our composer in the conception and
method of dramatic composition. In one of his letters
to Edouard Devrient he says, speaking of &ldquo;Fidelio,&rdquo;
&ldquo;On looking into the score, as well as on listening to
the performance, I everywhere perceive Cherubini&rsquo;s dramatic
style of composition. It is true that Beethoven did not ape
that style, but it was before his mind as his most cherished
pattern.&rdquo; The unity of idea and musical colour between
&ldquo;Faniska&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fidelio&rdquo; seems to have been noted by
many critics both of contemporary and succeeding times.</p>

<p>Cherubini would gladly have written more for the
Viennese, by whom he had been so cordially treated; but
the unsettled times and his home-sickness for Paris
conspired to take him back to the city of his adoption.
He exhausted many efforts to find Mozart&rsquo;s tomb in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>251]</a></span>
Vienna, and desired to place a monument over his neglected
remains, but failed to locate the resting-place of one he
loved so much. Haydn, Beethoven, Hummel, Salieri, and
the other leading composers reluctantly parted with him,
and on April 1, 1806, his return to Paris was celebrated
by a brilliant f&ecirc;te improvised for him at the Conservatory.
Fate, however, had not done with her persecutions, for
fate in France took the shape of Napoleon, whose hostility,
easily aroused, was implacable; who aspired to rule the
arts and letters as he did armies and state policy; who
spared neither Cherubini nor Madame de Sta&euml;l. Cherubini
was neglected and insulted by authority, while honours
were showered on M&eacute;hul, Gr&eacute;try, Spontini, and Lesueur.
He sank into a state of profound depression, and it was
even reported in Vienna that he was dead. He forsook
music and devoted himself to drawing and botany. Had
he not been a great musician, it is probable he would
have excelled in pictorial art. One day the great painter
David entered the room where he was working in crayon
on a landscape of the Salvator Rosa style. So pleased
was the painter that he cried, &ldquo;Truly admirable!
Courage!&rdquo; In 1808 Cherubini found complete rest in a
visit to the country-seat of the Prince de Chimay in
Belgium, whither he was accompanied by his friend and
pupil, Auber.</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>With this period Cherubini closed his career practically
as an operatic composer, though several dramatic works
were produced subsequently, and entered on his no less
great sphere of ecclesiastical composition. At Chimay for
a while no one dared to mention music in his presence.
Drawing and painting flowers seemed to be his sole pleasure.
At last the president of the little music society at Chimay
ventured to ask him to write a mass for St. Cecilia&rsquo;s feast-day.
He curtly refused, but his hostess noticed that he
was agitated by the incident, as if his slumbering instincts
had started again into life. One day the Princess placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>252]</a></span>
music paper on his table, and Cherubini on returning from
his walk instantly began to compose, as if he had never
ceased it. It is recorded that he traced out in full score
the &ldquo;Kyrie&rdquo; of his great mass in F during the intermission
of a single game of billiards. Only a portion of the mass
was completed in time for the festival, but, on Cherubini&rsquo;s
return to Paris in 1809, it was publicly given by an
admirable orchestra, and hailed with a great enthusiasm,
that soon swept through Europe. It was perceived that
Cherubini had struck out for himself a new path in church
music. F&eacute;tis, the musical historian, records its reception as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;All expressed an unreserved admiration for this
composition of a new order, whereby Cherubini has placed
himself above all musicians who have as yet written in the
concerted style of church music. Superior to the masses of
Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, and the masters of the
Neapolitan school, that of Cherubini is as remarkable for
originality of idea as for perfection in art.&rdquo; Picchiante, a
distinguished critic, sums up the impressions made by this
great work in the following eloquent and vigorous passage:&mdash;&ldquo;All
the musical science of the good age of religious music,
the sixteenth century of the Christian era, was summed up
in Palestrina, who flourished at that time, and by its aid he
put into form noble and sublime conceptions. With the
grave Gregorian melody, learnedly elaborated in vigorous
counterpoint and reduced to greater clearness and elegance
without instrumental aid, Palestrina knew how to awaken
among his hearers mysterious, grand, deep, vague sensations,
that seemed caused by the objects of an unknown world, or
by superior powers in the human imagination. With the
same profound thoughtfulness of the old Catholic music,
enriched by the perfection which art has attained in two
centuries, and with all the means which a composer
nowadays can make use of, Cherubini perfected another
conception, and this consisted in utilising the style adapted
to dramatic composition when narrating the church text,
by which means he was able to succeed in depicting man
in his various vicissitudes, now rising to the praises of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>253]</a></span>
Divinity, now gazing on the Supreme Power, now suppliant
and prostrate. So that, while Palestrina&rsquo;s music places
God before man, that of Cherubini places man before God.&rdquo;
Adolphe Adam puts the comparison more epigrammatically
in saying &ldquo;If Palestrina had lived in our own times, he
would have been Cherubini.&rdquo; The masters of the old
Roman school of church music had received it as an
emanation of pure sentiment, with no tinge of human
warmth and colour. Cherubini, on the contrary, aimed to
make his music express the dramatic passion of the words,
and in the realisation of this he brought to bear all the
resources of a musical science unequalled except perhaps by
Beethoven. The noble masses in F and D were also
written in 1809, and stamped themselves on public judgment
as no less powerful works of genius and knowledge.</p>

<p>Some of Cherubini&rsquo;s friends in 1809 tried to reconcile the
composer with the Emperor, and in furtherance of this an
opera was written anonymously, &ldquo;Pimmalione.&rdquo; Napoleon
was delighted, and even affected to tears. Instantly, however,
that Cherubini&rsquo;s name was uttered, he became dumb
and cold. Nevertheless, as if ashamed of his injustice, he
sent Cherubini a large sum of money, and a commission to
write the music for his marriage ode. Several fine works
followed in the next two years, among them the Mass in D,
regarded by some of his admirers as his ecclesiastical
masterpiece. Miel claims that in largeness of design and
complication of detail, sublimity of conception and dramatic
intensity, two works only of its class approach it,
Beethoven&rsquo;s Mass in D and Niedermeyer&rsquo;s Mass in D&nbsp;minor.</p>

<p>In 1811 Hal&eacute;vy, the future author of &ldquo;La Juive,&rdquo;
became Cherubini&rsquo;s pupil, and a devoted friendship ever
continued between the two. The opera of &ldquo;La Abenc&eacute;rages&rdquo;
was also produced, and it was pronounced nowise
inferior to &ldquo;M&eacute;d&eacute;e&rdquo; and &ldquo;Les Deux Journ&eacute;es.&rdquo; Mendelssohn,
many years afterwards, writing to Moscheles in
Paris, asked, &ldquo;Has Onslow written anything new? And
old Cherubini? There&rsquo;s a matchless fellow! I have got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>254]</a></span>
his &lsquo;Abenc&eacute;rages,&rsquo; and can not sufficiently admire the
sparkling fire, the clear original phrasing, the extraordinary
delicacy and refinement with which it is written, or feel
grateful enough to the grand old man for it. Besides, it is
all so free and bold and spirited.&rdquo; The work would have
had a greater immediate success, had not Paris been in
profound gloom from the disastrous results of the Moscow
campaign and the horrors of the French retreat, where famine
and disease finished the work of bayonet and cannon-ball.</p>

<p>The unsettled and disheartening times disturbed all the
relations of artists. There is but little record of Cherubini
for several years. A significant passage in a letter written
in 1814, speaking of several military marches written for a
Prussian band, indicates the occupation of Paris by the
allies and Napoleon&rsquo;s banishment in Elba. The period of
&ldquo;The Hundred Days&rdquo; was spent by Cherubini in England;
and the world&rsquo;s wonder, the battle of Waterloo, was fought,
and the Bourbons were permanently restored, before he
again set foot in Paris. The restored dynasty delighted to
honour the man whom Napoleon had slighted, and gifts
were showered on him alike by the Court and by the
leading academies of Europe. The walls of his studio
were covered with medals and diplomas; and his appointment
as director of the King&rsquo;s chapel (which, however, he
refused unless shared with Lesueur, the old incumbent)
placed him above the daily demands of want. So, at the
age of fifty-five, this great composer for the first time ceased
to be anxious on the score of his livelihood. Thenceforward
the life of Cherubini was destined to flow with a placid
current, its chief incidents being the great works in church
music, which he poured forth year after year, to the admiration
and delight of the artistic world. These remarkable
masses, by their dramatic power, greatness of design, and
wealth of instrumentation, excited as much discussion and
interest throughout Europe as the operas of other composers.
That written in 1816, the C&nbsp;minor requiem mass, is pronounced
by Berlioz to be the greatest work of this
description ever composed.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>255]</a></span></p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>As a man Cherubini presented himself in many different
aspects. Extremely nervous, <i>brusque</i>, irritable, and absolutely
independent, he was apt to offend and repel. But
under his stern reserve of character there beat a warm heart
and generous sympathies. This is shown by the fact that,
in spite of the unevenness of his temper, he was almost
worshipped by those around him. Auber, Hal&eacute;vy, Berton,
Bo&iuml;eldieu, M&eacute;hul, Spontini, and Adam, who were so intimately
associated with him, speak of him with words of
the warmest affection. Hal&eacute;vy, indeed, rarely alluded to
him without tears rushing to his eyes; and the slightest
term of disrespect excited his warmest indignation. It is
recorded that, after rebuking a pupil with sarcastic severity,
his fine face would relax with a smile so affectionate and
genial that his whilom victim could feel nothing but
enthusiastic respect. Without one taint of envy in his
nature, conscious of his own extraordinary powers, he was
quick to recognise genius in others; and his hearty praise
of the powers of his rivals shows how sound and generous
the heart was under his irritability. His proneness to
satire and power of epigram made him enemies, but even
these yielded to the suavity and fascination which alternated
with his bitter moods. His sympathies were peculiarly
open for young musicians. Mendelssohn and Liszt
were stimulated by his warm and encouraging praise when
they first visited Paris; and even Berlioz, whose turbulent
conduct in the Conservatory had so embittered him at
various times, was heartily applauded when his first great
mass was produced. Arnold gives us the following pleasant
picture of Cherubini:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cherubini in society was outwardly silent, modest,
unassuming, pleasing, obliging, and possessed of the finest
manners. At the same time, he who did not know that he
was with Cherubini would think him stern and reserved, so
well did the composer know how to conceal everything, if
only to avoid ostentation. He truly shunned brag or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>256]</a></span>
speaking of himself. Cherubini&rsquo;s voice was feeble, probably
from narrow-chestedness, and somewhat hoarse, but was
otherwise soft and agreeable. His French was Italianised....
His head was bent forward, his nose was large and
aquiline; his eyebrows were thick, black, and somewhat
bushy, overshadowing his eyes. His eyes were dark, and
glittered with an extraordinary brilliancy that animated in
a wonderful way the whole face. A thin lock of hair came
over the centre of his forehead, and somehow gave to his
countenance a peculiar softness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The picture painted by Ingres, the great artist, now in
the Luxembourg gallery, represents the composer with
Polyhymnia in the background stretching out her hand
over him. His face, framed in waving silvery hair, is full
of majesty and brightness, and the eye of piercing lustre.
Cherubini was so gratified by this effort of the painter that
he sent him a beautiful canon set to words of his own.
Thus his latter years were spent in the society of the great
artists and wits of Paris, revered by all, and recognised,
after Beethoven&rsquo;s death, as the musical giant of Europe.
Rossini, Meyerbeer, Weber, Schumann&mdash;in a word, the
representatives of the most diverse schools of composition&mdash;bowed
equally before this great name. Rossini, who was
his antipodes in genius and method, felt his loss bitterly,
and after his death sent Cherubini&rsquo;s portrait to his widow
with these touching words&mdash;&ldquo;Here, my dear madam, is the
portrait of a great man, who is as young in your heart as he
is in my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A mutual affection between Cherubini and Beethoven
existed through life, as is shown by the touching letter
written by the latter just before his death, but which
Cherubini did not receive till after that event. The letter
was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Vienna</span>, <i>March 15, 1823</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Highly esteemed Sir</span>&mdash;I joyfully take advantage of the opportunity
to address you.</p>

<p>I have done so often in spirit, as I prize your theatrical works
beyond others. The artistic world has only to lament that in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>257]</a></span>
Germany, at least, no new dramatic work of yours has appeared.
Highly as all your works are valued by true connoisseurs, still it is a
great loss to art not to possess any fresh production of your great
genius for the theatre.</p>

<p>True art is imperishable, and the true artist feels heartfelt pleasure
in grand works of genius, and that is what enchants me when I hear a
new composition of yours; in fact, I take greater interest in it than in
my own; in short, I love and honour you. Were it not that my
continued bad health stops my coming to see you in Paris, with what
exceeding delight would I discuss questions of art with you! Do not
think that this is meant merely to serve as an introduction to the
favour I am about to ask of you. I hope and feel sure that you do
not for a moment suspect me of such base sentiments. I recently
completed a grand solemn Mass, and have resolved to offer it to the
various European courts, as it is not my intention to publish it at
present. I have therefore asked the King of France, through the
French embassy here, to subscribe to this work, and I feel certain that
his Majesty would at your recommendation agree to do so.</p>

<p>My critical situation demands that I should not solely fix my eyes
upon heaven, as is my wont; on the contrary, it would have me fix
them also upon earth, here below, for the necessities of life.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the fate of my request to you, I shall for ever
continue to love and esteem you; and you for ever remain of all my
contemporaries that one whom I esteem the most.</p>

<p>If you should wish to do me a very great favour, you would effect
this by writing to me a few lines, which would solace me much. Art
unites all; how much more, then, true artists! and perhaps you may
deem me worthy of being included in that number.</p>

<p>With the highest esteem, your friend and servant,</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Ludwig van Beethoven</span>.</p>

<p class="address smcap">Ludwig Cherubini.</p>
</div>

<p>Cherubini&rsquo;s admiration of the great German is indicated
in an anecdote told by Professor Ella. The master rebuked
a pupil who, in referring to a performance of a Beethoven
symphony, dwelt mostly on the executive excellence&mdash;&ldquo;Young
man, let your sympathies be first wedded to the
creation, and be you less fastidious of the execution; accept
the interpretation, and think more of the creation of these
musical works which are written for all time and all
nations, models for imitation, and above all criticism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Actively engaged as Director of the Conservatory, which
he governed with consummate ability, his old age was
further employed in producing that series of great masses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>258]</a></span>
which rank with the symphonies of Beethoven. His
creative instinct and the fire of his imagination remained
unimpaired to the time of his death. Mendelssohn, in a
letter to Moscheles, speaks of him as &ldquo;that truly wonderful
old man, whose genius seems bathed in immortal youth.&rdquo;
His opera of &ldquo;Ali Baba,&rdquo; composed at seventy-six, though
inferior to his other dramatic works, is full of beautiful and
original music, and was immediately produced in several of
the principal capitals of Europe; and the second Requiem
mass, written in his eightieth year, is one of his masterpieces.</p>

<p>On the 12th of March 1842 the old composer died,
surrounded by his affectionate family and friends. His
fatal illness had been brought on in part by grief for the
death of his son-in-law, M. Turcas, to whom he was most
tenderly attached. His funeral was one of great military
and civic magnificence, and royalty itself could not have
been honoured with more splendid obsequies. The congregation
of men great in arms and state, in music,
painting, and literature, who did honour to the occasion,
has rarely been equalled. His own noble Requiem mass,
composed the year before his death, was given at the
funeral services in the church of St. Roch by the finest
orchestra and voices in Europe. Similar services were
held throughout Europe, and everywhere the opera-houses
were draped in black. Perhaps the death of no musician
ever called forth such universal exhibitions of sorrow and
reverence.</p>

<p>Cherubini&rsquo;s life extended from the early part of the reign
of Louis XVI. to that of Louis Philippe, and was contemporaneous
with many of the most remarkable events in
modern history. The energy and passion which convulsed
society during his youth and early manhood undoubtedly
had much to do in stimulating that robust and virile quality
in his mind which gave such character to his compositions.
The fecundity of his intellect is shown in the fact that he
produced four hundred and thirty works, out of which only
eighty have been published. In this catalogue there are
twenty-five operas and eleven masses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>259]</a></span>
As an operatic composer he laid the foundation of the
modern French school. Uniting the melody of the Italian
with the science of the German, his conceptions had a
dramatic fire and passion which were, however, free from
anything appertaining to the sensational and meretricious.
His forms were indeed classically severe, and his style is
defined by Adolphe Adam as the resurrection of the old
Italian school, enriched by the discoveries of modern
harmony. Though he was the creator of French opera as
we know it now, he was free from its vagaries and extravagances.
He set its model in the dramatic vigour and
picturesqueness, the clean-cut forms, and the noble instrumentation
which mark such masterpieces as &ldquo;Faniska,&rdquo;
&ldquo;M&eacute;d&eacute;e,&rdquo; &ldquo;Les Deux Journ&eacute;es,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lodo&iuml;ska.&rdquo; The
purity, classicism, and wealth of ideas in these works have
always caused them to be cited as standards of ideal
excellence. The reforms in opera of which Gluck was the
protagonist, and Wagner the extreme modern exponent,
characterise the dramatic works of Cherubini, though he
keeps them within that artistic limit which a proper regard
for melodic beauty prescribes. In the power and propriety
of musical declamation his operas are conceded to be without
a superior. His overtures hold their place in classical
music as ranking with the best ever written, and show a
richness of resource and knowledge of form in treating the
orchestra which his contemporaries admitted were only
equalled by Beethoven.</p>

<p>Cherubini&rsquo;s place in ecclesiastical music is that by which
he is best known to the musical public of to-day; for his
operas, owing to the immense demands they make on the
dramatic and vocal resources of the artist, are but rarely
presented in France, Germany, and England, and never in
America. They are only given where music is loved on
account of its noble traditions, and not for the mere sake of
idle and luxurious amusement. As a composer of masses,
however, Cherubini&rsquo;s genius is familiar to all who frequent
the services of the Roman Church. His relation to the
music of Catholicism accords with that of Sebastian Bach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>260]</a></span>
to the music of Protestantism. Haydn, Mozart, and even
Beethoven, are held by the best critics to be his inferiors in
this form of composition. His richness of melody, sense of
dramatic colour, and great command of orchestral effects,
gave him commanding power in the interpretation of religious
sentiments; while an ardent faith inspired with
passion, sweetness, and devotion what Place styles his
&ldquo;sublime visions.&rdquo; Miel, one of his most competent critics,
writes of him in this eloquent strain&mdash;&ldquo;If he represents the
passion and death of Christ, the heart feels itself wounded
with the most sublime emotion; and when he recounts the
&lsquo;Last Judgment&rsquo; the blood freezes with dread at the
redoubled and menacing calls of the exterminating angel.
All those admirable pictures that the Raphaels and Michael
Angelos have painted with colours and the brush, Cherubini
brings forth with the voice and orchestra.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In brief, if Cherubini is the founder of a later school of
opera, and the model which his successors have always
honoured and studied if they have not always followed, no
less is he the chief of a later, and by common consent the
greatest, school of modern church music.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> influence of Gluck was not confined to Cherubini,
but was hardly less manifest in moulding the style and
conceptions of M&eacute;hul and Spontini,<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> who held prominent
places in the history of the French opera. <span class="smcap">Henri &Eacute;tienne
M&eacute;hul</span> was the son of a French soldier stationed at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>261]</a></span>
Givet barracks, where he was born June 24, 1763. His
early love of music secured for him instructions from the
blind organist of the Franciscan church at that garrison
town, under whom he made astonishing progress. He soon
found he had outstripped the attainments of his teacher, and
contrived to place himself under the tuition of the celebrated
Wilhelm Hemser, who was organist at a neighbouring
monastery. Here M&eacute;hul spent a number of happy and
useful years, studying composition with Hemser and literature
with the kind monks, who hoped to persuade their
young charge to devote himself to ecclesiastical life.</p>

<p>M&eacute;hul&rsquo;s advent in Paris, whither he went at the age of
sixteen, soon opened his eyes to his true vocation, that of a
dramatic composer. The excitement over the contest
between Gluck and Piccini was then at its height, and the
youthful musician was not long in espousing the side of
Gluck with enthusiasm. He made the acquaintance of
Gluck accidentally, the great chevalier interposing one
night to prevent his being ejected from the theatre, into
one of whose boxes M&eacute;hul had slipped without buying a
ticket. Thenceforward the youth had free access to the
opera, and the friendship and tuition of one of the master
minds of the age.</p>

<p>An opera, &ldquo;Cora et Alonzo,&rdquo; had been composed at the
age of twenty and accepted at the opera; but it was not till
1790 that he got a hearing in the comic opera of &ldquo;Euphrasque
et Coradin,&rdquo; composed under the direction of Gluck.
This work was brilliantly successful, and &ldquo;Stratonice,&rdquo;
which appeared two years afterwards, established his
reputation. The French critics describe both these early
works as being equally admirable in melody, orchestral
accompaniment, and dramatic effect. The stormiest year of
the revolution was not favourable to operatic composition,
and M&eacute;hul wrote but little music except pieces for republican
festivities, much to his own disgust, for he was by no
means a warm friend of the republic.</p>

<p>In 1797 he produced his &ldquo;Le Jeune Henri,&rdquo; which
nearly caused a riot in the theatre. The story displeased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>262]</a></span>
the republican audience, who hissed and hooted till the
turmoil compelled the fall of the curtain. They insisted,
however, on the overture, which is one of great beauty,
being performed over and over again, a compliment which
has rarely been accorded to any composer. M&eacute;hul&rsquo;s
appointment as inspector and professor in the newly organised
Conservatory, at the same time with Cherubini, left
him but little leisure for musical composition; but he
found time to write the spectacular opera &ldquo;Adrian,&rdquo; which
was fiercely condemned by a republican audience, not as a
musical failure, but because their alert and suspicious
tempers suspected in it covert allusions to the dead monarchy.
Even David, the painter, said he would set the
torch to the opera-house rather than witness the triumph
of a king. In 1806 M&eacute;hul produced the opera &ldquo;Uthal,&rdquo;
a work of striking vigour founded on an Ossianic theme,
in which he made the innovation of banishing the violins
from the orchestra, substituting therefor the violas.</p>

<p>It was in &ldquo;Joseph,&rdquo; however, composed in 1807, that
this composer vindicated his right to be called a musician
of great genius, and entered fully into a species of composition
befitting his grand style. Most of his contemporaries
were incapable of appreciating the greatness of the
work, though his gifted rival Cherubini gave it the warmest
praise. In Germany it met with instant and extended
success, and it is one of the few French operas of the old
school which still continue to be given on the German
stage. In England it is now frequently sung as an oratorio.
It is on this remarkable work that M&eacute;hul&rsquo;s lasting reputation
as a composer rests outside of his own nation. The
construction of the opera of &ldquo;Joseph&rdquo; is characterised by
admirable symmetry of form, dramatic power, and majesty
of the choral and concerted passages, while the sustained
beauty of the orchestration is such as to challenge comparison
with the greatest works of his contemporaries. Such at
least is the verdict of F&eacute;tis, who was by no means inclined
to be over-indulgent in criticising M&eacute;hul. The fault in this
opera, as in all of M&eacute;hul&rsquo;s works, appears to have been a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>263]</a></span>
lack of bright and graceful melody, though in the modern
tendencies of music this defect is rapidly being elevated
into a virtue.</p>

<p>The last eight years of M&eacute;hul&rsquo;s life were depressed by
melancholy and suffering, proceeding from pulmonary
disease. He resigned his place in the Conservatory, and
retired to a pleasant little estate near Paris, where he
devoted himself to raising flowers, and found some solace
in the society of his musical friends and former pupils, who
were assiduous in their attentions. Finally becoming
dangerously ill, he went to the island of Hy&egrave;res to find a
more genial climate. But here he pined for Paris and the
old companionships, and suffered more perhaps by fretting
for the intellectual cheer of his old life than he gained by
balmy air and sunshine. He writes to one of his friends
after a short stay at Hy&egrave;res&mdash;&ldquo;I have broken up all my
habits; I am deprived of all my old friends; I am alone
at the end of the world, surrounded by people whose
language I scarcely understand; and all this sacrifice to
obtain a little more sun. The air which best agrees with
me is that which I breathe among you.&rdquo; He returned to
Paris for a few weeks only, to breathe his last on October
18, 1817, aged fifty-four.</p>

<p>M&eacute;hul was a high-minded and benevolent man, wrapped
up in his art, and singularly childlike in the practical
affairs of life. Abhorring intrigue, he was above all petty
jealousies, and even sacrificed the situation of chapel-master
under Napoleon, because he believed it should have been
given to the greatest of his rivals, Cherubini. When he
died Paris recognised his goodness as a man as well as
greatness as a musician by a touching and spontaneous
expression of grief, and funeral honours were given him
throughout Europe. In 1822 his statue was crowned on
the stage of the Grand Opera, at a performance of his
&ldquo;Valentine de Rohan.&rdquo; Notwithstanding his early death,
he composed forty-two operas, and modern musicians and
critics give him a notable place among those who were
prominent in building up a national stage. A pupil and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>264]</a></span>
disciple of Gluck, a cordial co-worker with Cherubini, he
contributed largely to the glory of French music, not only
by his genius as a composer, but by his important labours
in the reorganisation of the Conservatory, that nursery
which has fed so much of the highest musical talent of the
world.</p>

It is a little singular that some of the most distinguished names
in the annals of French music were foreigners. Thus Gluck was a
German, as also was Meyerbeer, while Cherubini and Spontini were
Italians.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Luigi Gasparo Pacifico Spontini</span>, born of peasant
parents at Majolati, Italy, November 14, 1774, displayed
his musical passion at an early age. Designed for holy
orders from childhood, his priestly tutors could not make
him study; but he delighted in the service of the church,
with its organ and choir effects, for here his true vocation
asserted itself. He was wont, too, to hide in the belfry,
and revel in the roaring orchestra of metal, when the
chimes were rung. On one occasion a stroke of lightning
precipitated him from his dangerous perch to the floor
below, and the history of music nearly lost one of its great
lights. The bias of his nature was intractable, and he was
at last permitted to study music, at first under the charge
of his uncle Joseph, the cur&eacute; of Jesi, and finally at the
Naples Conservatory, where he was entered at the age of
sixteen.</p>

<p>His first opera, &ldquo;I Puntigli delle Donne,&rdquo; was composed
at the age of twenty-one, and performed at Rome, where it
was kindly received. The French invasion unsettled the
affairs of Italy, and Spontini wandered somewhat aimlessly,
unable to exercise his talents to advantage till he went to
Paris in 1803, where he found a large number of brother
Italian musicians, and a cordial reception, though himself
an obscure and untried youth. He produced several
minor works on the French stage, noticeably among them
the one-act opera of &ldquo;Milton,&rdquo; in which he stepped boldly
out of his Italian mannerism, and entered on that path
afterwards pursued with such brilliancy and boldness. Yet,
though his talents began to be recognised, life was a trying
struggle, and it is doubtful if he could have overcome the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>265]</a></span>
difficulties in his way when he was ready to produce &ldquo;La
Vestale,&rdquo; had he not enlisted the sympathies of the
Empress Josephine, who loved music, and played the part
of patroness as gracefully as she did all others.</p>

<p>By Napoleon&rsquo;s order &ldquo;La Vestale&rdquo; was rehearsed
against the wish of the manager and critics of the
Academy of Music, and produced December 15, 1807.
Previous to this some parts of it had been performed
privately at the Tuileries, and the Emperor had said,
&ldquo;M. Spontini, your opera abounds in fine airs and effective
duets. The march to the place of execution is admirable.
You will certainly have the great success you so well
deserve.&rdquo; The imperial prediction was justified by consecutive
performances of one hundred nights. His next
work, &ldquo;Fernand Cortez,&rdquo; sustained the impression of
genius earned for him by its predecessor. The scene of
the revolt is pronounced by competent critics to be one of
the finest dramatic conceptions in operatic music.</p>

<p>In 1809 Spontini married the niece of Erard, the great
pianoforte-maker, and was called to the direction of the
Italian opera; but he retained this position only two
years, from the disagreeable conditions he had to contend
with, and the cabals that were formed against him. The
year 1814 witnessed the production of &ldquo;P&eacute;lage,&rdquo; and two
years later &ldquo;Les Dieux Rivaux&rdquo; was composed, in
conjunction with Persuis, Berton, and Kreutzer; but
neither work attracted much attention. The opera of
&ldquo;Olympie,&rdquo; worked out on the plan of &ldquo;La Vestale&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Cortez,&rdquo; was produced in 1819. Spontini was embittered
by its poor success, for he had built many hopes on it, and
wrought long and patiently. That he was not in his
best vein, and like many other men of genius was not
always able to estimate justly his own work, is undeniable;
for Spontini, contrary to the opinion of his contemporaries
and of posterity, regarded this as his best opera. His
acceptance of the Prussian King&rsquo;s offer to become musical
director at Berlin was the result of his chagrin. Here he
remained for twenty years. &ldquo;Olympie&rdquo; succeeded better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>266]</a></span>
at Berlin, though the boisterousness of the music seems to
have called out some sharp strictures even among the
Berlinese, whose penchant for noisy operatic effects was
then as now a butt for the satire of the musical wits.
Apropos of the long run of &ldquo;Olympie&rdquo; at Berlin, an
amusing anecdote is told on the authority of Castel-Blaze.
A wealthy amateur had become deaf, and suffered much
from his deprivation of the enjoyment of his favourite art.
After trying many physicians, he was treated in a novel
fashion by his latest doctor. &ldquo;Come with me to the opera
this evening,&rdquo; wrote down the doctor. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?
I can&rsquo;t hear a note,&rdquo; was the impatient rejoinder. &ldquo;Never
mind,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;come, and you will see something
at all events.&rdquo; So the twain repaired to the theatre to
hear Spontini&rsquo;s &ldquo;Olympie.&rdquo; All went well till one of the
overwhelming finales, which happened to be played that
evening more <i>fortissimo</i> than usual. The patient turned
around beaming with delight, exclaiming, &ldquo;Doctor, I can
hear.&rdquo; As there was no reply, the happy patient again
said, &ldquo;Doctor, I tell you, you have cured me.&rdquo; A blank
stare alone met him, and he found that the doctor was as
deaf as a post, having fallen a victim to his own prescription.
The German wits had a similar joke afterwards at
Hal&eacute;vy&rsquo;s expense. The <i>Punch</i> of Vienna said that
Hal&eacute;vy made the brass play so loudly that the French horn
was actually blown quite straight.</p>

<p>Among the works produced at Berlin were &ldquo;Nurmahal,&rdquo;
in 1825; &ldquo;Alcidor,&rdquo; the same year; and 1829, &ldquo;Agnes
von Hohenstaufen.&rdquo; Various other new works were given
from time to time, but none achieved more than a brief
hearing. Spontini&rsquo;s stiff-necked and arrogant will kept
him in continual trouble, and the Berlin press aimed its
arrows at him with incessant virulence: a war which the
composer fed by his bitter and witty rejoinders, for he was
an adept in the art of invective. Had he not been
singularly adroit, he would have been obliged to leave his
post. But he gloried in the disturbance he created, and
was proof against the assaults of his numerous enemies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>267]</a></span>
made so largely by his having come of the French school,
then as now an all-sufficient cause of Teutonic dislike.
Spontini&rsquo;s unbending intolerance, however, at last undermined
his musical supremacy, so long held good with an
iron hand; and an intrigue headed by Count Br&uuml;hl,
intendant of the Royal Theatre, at last obliged him to
resign after a rule of a score of years. His influence on
the lyric theatre of Berlin, however, had been valuable, and
he had the glory of forming singers among the Prussians,
who until his time had thought more of cornet-playing than
of beautiful and true vocalisation. The Prussian King
allowed him on his departure a pension of 16,000 francs.</p>

<p>When Spontini returned to Paris, though he was
appointed member of the Academy of Fine Arts, he was
received with some coldness by the musical world. He had
no little difficulty in getting a production of his operas;
only the Conservatory remained faithful to him, and in
their hall large audiences gathered to hear compositions to
which the opera-house denied its stage. New idols attracted
the public, and Spontini, though burdened with all the
orders of Europe, was obliged to rest in the traditions of
his earlier career. A passionate desire to see his native
land before death made him leave Paris in 1850, and
he went to Majolati, the town of his birth, where he died
after a residence of a few months in 1851. His cradle was
his tomb.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>A well-known musical critic sums up his judgment of
Hal&eacute;vy in these words&mdash;&ldquo;If in France a contemporary of
Louis XIV., an admirer of Racine, could return to us, and,
full of the remembrance of his earthly career under that
renowned monarch, he should wish to find the nobly
pathetic, the elevated inspiration, the majestic arrangements
of the olden times upon a modern stage, we would
not take him to the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais, but to the Opera on
the day in which one of Hal&eacute;vy&rsquo;s works was given.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unlike M&eacute;hul and Spontini, with whom in point of style
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>268]</a></span>
and method Hal&eacute;vy must be associated, he was not in any
direct sense a disciple of Gluck, but inherited the influence
of the latter through his great successor Cherubini, of whom
Hal&eacute;vy was the favourite pupil and the intimate friend.
<span class="smcap">Fromental Hal&eacute;vy</span>, a scion of the Hebrew race, which has
furnished so many geniuses to the art world, left a deep
impress on his times, not simply by his genius and musical
knowledge, which was profound, varied, and accurate, but
by the elevation and nobility which lifted his mark up to a
higher level than that which we accord to mere musical
gifts, be they ever so rich and fertile. The motive that
inspired his life is suggested in his devout saying that music
is an art that God has given us, in which the voices of all
nations may unite their prayers in one harmonious rhythm.</p>

<p>Hal&eacute;vy was a native of Paris, born May 27, 1799. He
entered the Conservatory at the age of eleven years, where
he soon attracted the particular attention of Cherubini.
When he was twenty the Institute awarded him the grand
prize for the composition of a cantata; and he also received
a government pension which enabled him to dwell at Rome
for two years, assiduously cultivating his talents in
composition. Hal&eacute;vy returned to Paris, but it was not till
1827 that he succeeded in having an opera produced. This
portion of his life was full of disappointment and chilled
ambitions; for, in spite of the warm friendship of
Cherubini, who did everything to advance his interests,
he seemed to make but slow progress in popular estimation,
though a number of operas were produced.</p>

<p>Hal&eacute;vy&rsquo;s full recognition, however, was found in the
great work of &ldquo;La Juive,&rdquo; produced February 23, 1835,
with lavish magnificence. It is said that the managers of
the Opera expended 150,000 francs in putting it on the
stage. This opera, which surpasses all his others in
passion, strength, and dignity of treatment, was interpreted
by the greatest singers in Europe, and the public
reception at once assured the composer that his place in
music was fixed. Many envious critics, however, declaimed
against him, asserting that success was not the legitimate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>269]</a></span>
desert of the opera, but of its magnificent presentation.
Hal&eacute;vy answered his detractors by giving the world a
delightful comic opera, &ldquo;L&rsquo;&Eacute;clair,&rdquo; which at once testified
to the genuineness of his musical inspiration and the
versatility of his powers, and was received by the public
with even more pleasure than &ldquo;La Juive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hal&eacute;vy&rsquo;s next brilliant stroke (three unsuccessful works
in the meanwhile having been written) was &ldquo;La Reine
de Chypre,&rdquo; produced in 1841. A somewhat singular fact
occurred during the performance of this opera. One of the
singers, every time he came to the passage,</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Ce mortel qu&rsquo;on remarque<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Tient-il<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plus que nous de la Parque<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Le fil?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>was in the habit of fixing his eyes on a certain proscenium
box wherein were wont to sit certain notabilities in politics
and finance. As several of these died during the first run
of the work, superstitious people thought the box was
bewitched, and no one cared to occupy it. Two fine works,
&ldquo;Charles VI.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Le Val d&rsquo;Andorre,&rdquo; succeeded at
intervals of a few years; and in 1849 the noble music
to &AElig;schylus&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prometheus Bound&rdquo; was written with an
idea of reproducing the supposed effects of the enharmonic
style of the Greeks.</p>

<p>Hal&eacute;vy&rsquo;s opera of &ldquo;The Tempest,&rdquo; written for London,
and produced in 1850, rivalled the success of &ldquo;La Juive.&rdquo;
Balfe led the orchestra, and its popularity caused the basso
Lablache to write the following epigram:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The &lsquo;Tempest&rsquo; of Hal&eacute;vy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Differs from other tempests.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These rain hail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That rains gold.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Academy of Fine Arts elected the composer secretary
in 1854, and in the exercise of his duties, which involved
considerable literary composition, Hal&eacute;vy showed the same
elegance of style and good taste which marked his musical
writings. He did not, however, neglect his own proper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>270]</a></span>
work, and a succession of operas, which were cordially received,
proved how unimpaired and vigorous his intellectual
faculties remained.</p>

<p>The composer&rsquo;s death occurred at Nice, whither he had
gone on account of failing strength, March 17, 1862. His
last moments were cheered by the attentions of his family
and the consolations of philosophy and literature, which
he dearly loved to discuss with his friends. His ruling
passion displayed itself shortly before his end in characteristic
fashion. Trying in vain to reach a book on the table,
he said, &ldquo;Can I do nothing now in time?&rdquo; On the morning
of his death, wishing to be turned on his bed, he said
to his daughter, &ldquo;Lay me down like a gamut,&rdquo; at each
movement repeating, with a soft smile, &ldquo;<i>Do</i>, <i>re</i>, <i>mi</i>,&rdquo; etc.,
until the change was made. These were his last words.</p>

<p>The celebrated French critic Sainte-Beuve pays a charming
tribute to Hal&eacute;vy, whom he knew and loved well:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hal&eacute;vy had a natural talent for writing, which he cultivated
and perfected by study, by a taste for reading
which he always gratified in the intervals of labour, in his
study, in public conveyances&mdash;everywhere, in fine, when
he had a minute to spare. He could isolate himself completely
in the midst of the various noises of his family, or
the conversation of the drawing-room if he had no part in
it. He wrote music, poetry, and prose, and he read
with imperturbable attention while people around him
talked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He possessed the instinct of languages, was familiar
with German, Italian, English, and Latin, knew something
of Hebrew and Greek. He was conversant with etymology,
and had a perfect passion for dictionaries. It was often
difficult for him to find a word; for on opening the dictionary
somewhere near the word for which he was looking, if
his eye chanced to fall on some other, no matter what, he
stopped to read that, then another and another, until he
sometimes forgot the word he sought. It is singular that
this estimable man, so fully occupied, should at times have
nourished some secret sadness. Whatever the hidden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>271]</a></span>
wound might be, none, not even his most intimate friends,
knew what it was. He never made any complaint.
Hal&eacute;vy&rsquo;s nature was rich, open, and communicative. He
was well organised, accessible to the sweets of sociability
and family joys. In fine, he had, as one may say, too
many strings to his bow to be very unhappy for any length
of time. To define him practically, I would say he was a
bee that had not lodged himself completely in his hive, but
was seeking to make honey elsewhere too.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>M&eacute;hul laboured successfully in adapting the noble and
severe style of Gluck to the changing requirements of the
French stage. The turmoil and passions of the revolution
had stirred men&rsquo;s souls to the very roots, and this influence
was perpetuated and crystallised in the new forms given to
French thought by Napoleon&rsquo;s wonderful career. M&eacute;hul&rsquo;s
musical conceptions, which culminated in the opera of
&ldquo;Joseph,&rdquo; were characterised by a stir, a vigour, and
largeness of dramatic movement, which came close to the
familiar life of that remarkable period. His great rival,
Cherubini, on the other hand, though no less truly dramatic
in fitting musical expression to thought and passion, was so
austere and rigid in his ideals, so dominated by musical
form and an accurate science which would concede nothing
to popular prejudice and ignorance, that he won his laurels,
not by force of the natural flow of popular sympathy, but
by the sheer might of his genius. Cherubini&rsquo;s severe works
made them models and foundation-stones for his successors
in French music; but M&eacute;hul familiarised his audiences
with strains dignified yet popular, full of massive effects
and brilliant combinations. The people felt the tramp
of the Napoleonic armies in the vigour and movement of
his measures.</p>

<p>Spontini embodied the same influences and characteristics
in still larger degree, for his musical genius was organised
on a more massive plan. Deficient in pure, graceful melody
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>272]</a></span>
alike with M&eacute;hul, he delighted in great masses of tone and
vivid orchestral colouring. His music was full of the military
fire of his age, and dealt for the most part with the
peculiar tastes and passions engendered by a condition of
chronic warfare. Therefore dramatic movement in his
operas was always of the heroic order, and never touched
the more subtile and complex elements of life. Spontini
added to the majestic repose and ideality of the Gluck
music-drama (to use a name now naturalised in art by
Wagner) the keenest dramatic vigour. Though he had a
strong command of effects by his power of delineation and
delicacy of detail, his prevalent tastes led him to encumber
his music too often with overpowering military effects, alike
tonal and scenic. Riehl, a great German critic, says&mdash;&ldquo;He
is more successful in the delineation of masses and groups
than in the pourtrayal of emotional scenes; his rendering
of the national struggle between the Spaniards and Mexicans
in &lsquo;Cortez&rsquo; is, for example, admirable. He is likewise
most successful in the management of large masses in the
instrumentation. In this respect he was, like Napoleon, a
great tactician.&rdquo; In &ldquo;La Vestale&rdquo; Spontini attained his
<i>chef-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i>. Schl&uuml;ter, in his <i>History of Music</i>, gives it
the following encomium&mdash;&ldquo;His pourtrayal of character and
truthful delineation of passionate emotion in this opera are
masterly indeed. The subject of &lsquo;La Vestale&rsquo; (which
resembles that of &lsquo;Norma,&rsquo; but how differently treated!) is
tragic and sublime as well as intensely emotional. Julia,
the heroine, a prey to guilty passion; the severe but kindly
high priestess; Licinius, the adventurous lover, and his
faithful friend Cinna; pious vestals, cruel priests, bold
warriors, and haughty Romans, are represented with statuesque
relief and finish. Both these works, &lsquo;La Vestale&rsquo;
(1807) and &lsquo;Cortez&rsquo; (1809), are among the finest that have
been written for the stage; they are remarkable for naturalness
and sublimeness, qualities lost sight of in the noisy
instrumentation of his later works.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hal&eacute;vy, trained under the influences of Cherubini, was
largely inspired by that great master&rsquo;s musical purism and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>273]</a></span>
reverence for the higher laws of his art. Hal&eacute;vy&rsquo;s powerful
sense of the dramatic always influenced his methods and
sympathies. Not being a composer of creative imagination,
however, the melodramatic element is more prominent than
the purely tragic or comic. His music shows remarkable
resources in the production of brilliant and captivating,
though always tasteful, effects, which rather please the
senses and the fancy than stir the heart and imagination.
Here and there scattered through his works, notably so in
&ldquo;La Juive,&rdquo; are touches of emotion and grandeur; but
Hal&eacute;vy must be characterised as a composer who is rather
distinguished for the brilliancy, vigour, and completeness of
his art than for the higher creative power, which belongs in
such pre-eminent degree to men like Rossini and Weber, or
even to Auber, Meyerbeer, and Gounod. It is nevertheless
true that Hal&eacute;vy composed works which will retain a high
rank in French art &ldquo;La Juive,&rdquo; &ldquo;Guido,&rdquo; &ldquo;La Reine de
Chypre,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Charles VI.&rdquo; are noble lyric dramas, full of
beauties, though it is said they can never be seen to the best
advantage off the French stage. Hal&eacute;vy&rsquo;s genius and taste
in music bear much the same relation to the French stage as
do those of Verdi to the Italian stage; though the former
composer is conceded by critics to be a greater purist in
musical form, if he rarely equals the Italian composer in
the splendid bursts of musical passion with which the latter
redeems so much that is meretricious and false, and the
charming melody which Verdi shares with his countrymen.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> French school of light opera, founded by Gr&eacute;try,
reached its greatest perfection in the authors of &ldquo;La
Dame Blanche&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fra Diavolo,&rdquo; though to the former
of these composers must be accorded the peculiar distinction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>274]</a></span>
of having given the most perfect example of this style of
composition. <span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;ois Adrien Bo&iuml;eldieu</span>, the scion of a
Norman family, was born at Rouen, December 16, 1775.
He received his early musical training at the hands of
Broche, a great musician and the cathedral organist, but a
drunkard and brutal taskmaster. At the age of sixteen he
had become a good pianist and knew something of composition.
At all events, his passionate love of the theatre
prompted him to try his hand at an opera, which was
actually performed at Rouen. The revolution which made
such havoc with the clergy and their dependants ruined the
Bo&iuml;eldieu family (the elder Bo&iuml;eldieu had been secretary of
the archiepiscopal diocese), and young Fran&ccedil;ois, at the age
of nineteen, was set adrift on the world, his heart full of
hope and his ambition bent on Paris, whither he set his
feet. Paris, however, proved a stern stepmother at the
outset, as she always has been to the struggling and unsuccessful.
He was obliged to tune pianos for his living, and
was glad to sell his brilliant <i>chansons</i>, which afterwards
made a fortune for his publisher, for a few francs apiece.</p>

<p>Several years of hard work and bitter privation finally
culminated in the acceptance of an opera, &ldquo;La Famille
Suisse,&rdquo; at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Faydeau in 1796, where it was
given on alternate nights with Cherubini&rsquo;s &ldquo;M&eacute;d&eacute;e.&rdquo;
Other operas followed in rapid succession, among which
may be mentioned &ldquo;La Dot de Suzette&rdquo; (1798) and &ldquo;Le
Calife de Bagdad&rdquo; (1800). The latter of these was
remarkably popular, and drew from the severe Cherubini
the following rebuke&mdash;&ldquo;Malheureux! Are you not
ashamed of such undeserved triumph?&rdquo; Bo&iuml;eldieu took
the brusque criticism meekly and preferred a request for
further instruction from Cherubini&mdash;a proof of modesty
and good sense quite remarkable in one who had attained
recognition as a favourite with the musical public. Bo&iuml;eldieu&rsquo;s
three years&rsquo; studies under the great Italian master
were of much service, for his next work, &ldquo;Ma Tante
Aurore,&rdquo; produced in 1803, showed noticeable artistic
progress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>275]</a></span>
It was during this year that Bo&iuml;eldieu, goaded by
domestic misery (for he had married the danseuse Clotilde
Mafleuray, whose notorious infidelity made his name a bye-word),
exiled himself to Russia, even then looked on as an
El Dorado for the musician, where he spent eight years as
conductor and composer of the Imperial Opera. This was
all but a total eclipse in his art-life, for he did little of note
during the period of his St. Petersburg career.</p>

<p>He returned to Paris in 1811, where he found great
changes. M&eacute;hul and Cherubini, disgusted with the public,
kept an obstinate silence; and Nicolo was not a dangerous
rival. He set to work with fresh zeal, and one of his most
charming works, &ldquo;Jean de Paris,&rdquo; produced in 1812, was
received with a storm of delight. This and &ldquo;La Dame
Blanche&rdquo; are the two masterpieces of the composer in
refined humour, masterly delineation, and sustained power
both of melody and construction. The fourteen years
which elapsed before Bo&iuml;eldieu&rsquo;s genius took a still higher
flight were occupied in writing works of little value except
as names in a catalogue. The long-expected opera &ldquo;La
Dame Blanche&rdquo; saw the light in 1825, and it is to-day a
stock opera in Europe, one Parisian theatre alone having
given it nearly two thousand times. Bo&iuml;eldieu&rsquo;s latter
years were uneventful and unfruitful. He died in 1834 of
pulmonary disease, the germs of which were planted by
St. Petersburg winters. &ldquo;Jean de Paris&rdquo; and &ldquo;La Dame
Blanche&rdquo; are the two works, out of nearly thirty operas,
which the world cherishes as masterpieces.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel Fran&ccedil;ois Esprit Auber</span> was born at Caen,
Normandy, January 29, 1784. He was destined by his
parents for a mercantile career, and was articled to a
French firm in London to perfect himself in commercial
training. As a child he showed his passion and genius for
music, a fact so noticeable in the lives of most of the great
musicians. He composed ballads and romances at the age
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>276]</a></span>
of eleven, and during his London life was much sought
after as a musical prodigy alike in composition and execution.
In consequence of the breach of the treaty of Amiens
in 1804, he was obliged to return to Paris, and we hear no
more of the counting-room as a part of his life. His resetting
of an old libretto in 1811 attracted the attention of
Cherubini, who impressed himself so powerfully on French
music and musicians, and the master offered to superintend
his further studies, a chance eagerly seized by Auber. To
the instruction of Cherubini Auber owed his mastery over
the technical difficulties of his art. Among the pieces
written at this time was a mass for the Prince of Chimay,
of which the prayer was afterwards transferred to
&ldquo;Masaniello.&rdquo; The comic opera &ldquo;Le S&eacute;jour Militaire,&rdquo;
produced in 1813, when Auber was thirty, was really his
d&eacute;but as a composer. It was coldly received, and it was
not till the loss of private fortune set a sharp spur to his
creative activity that he set himself to serious work. &ldquo;La
Berg&egrave;re Ch&acirc;telaine,&rdquo; produced in 1820, was his first
genuine success, and equal fortune attended &ldquo;Emma&rdquo; in
the following season.</p>

<p>The duration and climax of Auber&rsquo;s musical career were
founded on his friendship and artistic alliance with Scribe,
one of the most fertile librettists and playwrights of modern
times. To this union, which lasted till Scribe&rsquo;s death, a
great number of operas, comic and serious, owe their
existence: not all of equal value, but all evincing the
apparently inexhaustible productive genius of the joint
authors. The works on which Auber&rsquo;s claims to musical
greatness rest are as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Leicester,&rdquo; 1822; &ldquo;Le
Ma&ccedil;on,&rdquo; 1825, the composer&rsquo;s <i>chef-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i> in comic opera;
&ldquo;La Muette de Portici,&rdquo; otherwise &ldquo;Masaniello,&rdquo; 1828;
&ldquo;Fra Diavolo,&rdquo; 1830; &ldquo;Lestocq,&rdquo; 1835; &ldquo;Le Cheval de
Bronze,&rdquo; 1835; &ldquo;L&rsquo;Ambassadrice,&rdquo; 1836; &ldquo;Le Domino
Noir,&rdquo; 1837; &ldquo;Les Diamants de la Couronne,&rdquo; 1841;
&ldquo;Carlo Braschi,&rdquo; 1842; &ldquo;Hayd&eacute;e,&rdquo; 1847; &ldquo;L&rsquo;Enfant
Prodigue,&rdquo; 1850; &ldquo;Zerline,&rdquo; 1851, written for Madame
Alboni; &ldquo;Manon Lescaut,&rdquo; 1856; &ldquo;La Fianc&eacute;e du Roi de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>277]</a></span>
Garbe,&rdquo; 1867; &ldquo;Le Premier Jour de Bonheur,&rdquo; 1868;
and &ldquo;Le R&ecirc;ve d&rsquo;Amour,&rdquo; 1869. The last two works were
composed after Auber had passed his eightieth year.</p>

<p>The indifference of this Anacreon of music to renown is
worthy of remark. He never attended the performance of
his own pieces, and disdained applause. The highest and
most valued distinctions were showered on him; orders,
jewelled swords, diamond snuff-boxes, were poured in from
all the courts of Europe. Innumerable invitations urged
him to visit other capitals, and receive honour from
imperial hands. But Auber was a true Parisian, and
could not be induced to leave his beloved city. He was a
Member of the Institute, Commander of the Legion of
Honour, and Cherubini&rsquo;s successor as Director of the
Conservatory. He enjoyed perfect health up to the day
of his death in 1871. Assiduous in his duties at the
Conservatory, and active in his social relations, which took
him into the most brilliant circles of an extended period,
covering the reigns of Napoleon I., Charles X., Louis
Philippe, and Napoleon III., he yet always found time to
devote several hours a day to composition. Auber was a
small, delicate man, yet distinguished in appearance, and
noted for wit. His <i>bons mots</i> were celebrated. While
directing a musical <i>soir&eacute;e</i> when over eighty, a gentleman
having taken a white hair from his shoulder, he said,
laughingly, &ldquo;This hair must belong to some old fellow who
passed near me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A good anecdote is told <i>&agrave; propos</i> of an interview of
Auber with Charles X. in 1830. &ldquo;Masaniello,&rdquo; a bold and
revolutionary work, had just been produced, and stirred
up a powerful popular ferment. &ldquo;Ah, M. Auber,&rdquo; said
the King, &ldquo;you have no idea of the good your work has
done me.&rdquo; &ldquo;How, sire?&rdquo; &ldquo;All revolutions resemble each
other. To sing one is to provoke one. What can I do to
please you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah, sire! I am not ambitious.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am
disposed to name you director of the court concerts. Be
sure that I shall remember you. But,&rdquo; added he, taking the
artist&rsquo;s arm with a cordial and confidential air, &ldquo;from this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>278]</a></span>
day forth you understand me well, M. Auber, I expect
you to bring out the &lsquo;Muette&rsquo; but <em>very seldom</em>.&rdquo; It is well
known that the Brussels riots of 1830, which resulted in
driving the Dutch out of the country, occurred immediately
after a performance of this opera, which thus acted the
part of &ldquo;Lillibulero&rdquo; in English political annals. It is a
striking coincidence that the death of the author of this
revolutionary inspiration, May 13, 1871, was partly caused
by the terrors of the Paris Commune.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Bo&iuml;eldieu and Auber are by far the most brilliant representatives
of the French school of Op&eacute;ra Comique. The
work of the former which shows his genius at its best is
&ldquo;La Dame Blanche.&rdquo; It possesses in a remarkable degree
dramatic <i>verve</i>, piquancy of rhythm, and beauty of structure.
Mr. Franz Hueffer speaks of this opera as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peculiar to Bo&iuml;eldieu is a certain homely sweetness of
melody which proves its kinship to that source of all truly
national music, the popular song. The &lsquo;Dame Blanche&rsquo;
might be considered as the artistic continuation of the
<i>chanson</i>, in the same sense as Weber&rsquo;s &lsquo;Der Freisch&uuml;tz&rsquo;
has been called a dramatised <i>Volkslied</i>. With regard to
Bo&iuml;eldieu&rsquo;s work, this remark indicates at the same time a
strong development of what has been described as the
&lsquo;amalgamating force of French art and culture;&rsquo; for it
must be borne in mind that the subject treated is Scotch.
The plot is a compound of two of Scott&rsquo;s novels&mdash;the
&lsquo;Monastery&rsquo; and &lsquo;Guy Mannering.&rsquo; Julian, <i>alias</i> George
Brown, comes to his paternal castle unknown to himself.
He hears the songs of his childhood, which awaken old
memories in him; but he seems doomed to misery and
disappointment, for on the day of his return his hall and
his broad acres are to become the property of a villain, the
unfaithful steward of his own family. Here is a situation
full of gloom and sad foreboding. But Scribe and Bo&iuml;eldieu
knew better. Their hero is a dashing cavalry officer, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>279]</a></span>
makes love to every pretty woman he comes across, the
&lsquo;White Lady of Avenel&rsquo; among the number. Yet no one
who has witnessed the impersonation of George Brown by
the great Roger can have failed to be impressed with the
grace and noble gallantry of the character.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tune of &ldquo;Robin Adair,&rdquo; introduced by Bo&iuml;eldieu
and described as &ldquo;le chant ordinaire de la tribu d&rsquo;Avenel,&rdquo;
would hardly be recognised by a genuine Scotchman; but
what it loses in homely vigour it has gained in sweetness.
The musician&rsquo;s taste is always gratified in Bo&iuml;eldieu&rsquo;s two
great comic operas by the grace and finish of the instrumentation,
and the carefully composed <i>ensembles</i>, while the
public is delighted with the charming ballads and songs.
The airs of &ldquo;La Dame Blanche&rdquo; are more popular in
classic Germany than those of any other opera. Bo&iuml;eldieu
may then be characterised as the composer who carried the
French operetta to its highest development, and endowed it
in the fullest sense with all the grace, sparkle, dramatic
symmetry, and gamesome touch so essentially the heritage
of the nation.</p>

<p>Auber&rsquo;s position in art may be defined as that of the last
great representative of French comic opera, the legitimate
successor of Bo&iuml;eldieu, whom he surpasses in refinement
and brilliancy of individual effects, while he is inferior in
simplicity, breadth, and that firm grasp of details which
enables the composer to blend all the parts into a perfect
whole. In spite of the fact that &ldquo;La Muette,&rdquo; Auber&rsquo;s
greatest opera, is a romantic and serious work, full of bold
strokes of genius that astonish no less than they please, he
must be held to be essentially a master in the field of
operatic comedy. In the great opera to which allusion has
been made, the passions of excited public feeling have their
fullest sway, and heroic sentiments of love and devotion are
expressed in a manner alike grand and original. The
traditional forms of the opera are made to expand with the
force of the feeling bursting through them. But this was
the sole flight of Auber into the higher regions of his art,
the offspring of the thoroughly revolutionised feeling of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>280]</a></span>
time (1828), which within two years shook Europe with
such force. Aside from this outcome of his Berserker mood,
Auber is a charming exponent of the grace, brightness, and
piquancy of French society and civilisation. If rarely deep,
he is never dull, and no composer has given the world more
elegant and graceful melodies of the kind which charm the
drawing-room and furnish a good excuse for young-lady
pianism.</p>

<p>The following sprightly and judicious estimate of Auber
by one of the ablest of modern critics, Henry Chorley, in
the main fixes him in his right place:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He falls short of his mark in situations of profound
pathos (save perhaps in his sleep-song of &lsquo;Masaniello&rsquo;).
He is greatly behind his Italian brethren in those mad
scenes which they so largely affect. He is always light and
piquant for voices, delicious in his treatment of the orchestra,
and at this moment of writing&mdash;though I believe the
patriarch of opera-writers (born, it is said, in 1784), having
begun to compose at an age when other men have died
exhausted by precocious labour&mdash;is perhaps the lightest-hearted,
lightest-handed man still pouring out fragments
of pearl and spangles of pure gold on the stage.... With
all this it is remarkable as it is unfair, that among
musicians&mdash;when talk is going around, and this person
praises that portentous piece of counterpoint, and the other
analyses some new chord the ugliness of which has led to
its being neglected by former composers&mdash;the name of this
brilliant man is hardly if ever heard at all. His is the
next name among the composers belonging to the last thirty
years which should be heard after that of Rossini, the
number and extent of the works produced by him taken
into account, and with these the beauties which they
contain.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="meyerbeer" id="meyerbeer"></a><i>MEYERBEER.</i></h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Few</span> great names in art have been the occasion of such
diversity of judgment as Giacomo Meyerbeer, whose works
fill so large a place in French music. By one school of
critics he is lauded beyond all measure as one &ldquo;whose
scientific skill and gorgeous orchestration are only equalled
by his richness of melody and genius for dramatic and
scenic effects; by far the greatest composer of recent
years;&rdquo; by another class we hear him stigmatised as
&ldquo;the very caricature of the universal Mozart ... the
Cosmopolitan Jew, who hawks his wares among all nations
indifferently, and does his best to please customers of every
kind.&rdquo; The truth lies between the two, as is wont to be
the case in such extremes of opinion. Meyerbeer&rsquo;s remarkable
talent so nearly approaches genius as to make the
distinction a difficult one. He cannot be numbered
among those great creative artists who by force of individuality
have moulded musical epochs and left an undying
imprint on their own and succeeding ages. On the other
hand, his remarkable power of combining the resources of
the lyric stage in a grand mosaic of all that can charm the
eye and ear, of wedding rich and gorgeous music with
splendid spectacle, gives him an unique place in music; for,
unlike Wagner, whose ideas of stage necessities are no less
exacting, Meyerbeer aims at no reforms in lyric music, but
only to develop the old forms to their highest degree of
effect, under conditions that shall gratify the general
artistic sense. To accomplish this, he spares no means
either in or out of music. Though a German, there is but
little of the Teutonic <i>genre</i> in the music of Weber&rsquo;s fellow-pupil.
When at the outset he wrote for Italy, he showed
but little of that easy assumption of the genius of Italian art
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>282]</a></span>
which many other foreign composers have attained. It
was not till he formed his celebrated art partnership with
Scribe, the greatest of librettists, and succeeded in opening
the gates of the Grand Opera of Paris with all its resources,
more vast than exist anywhere else, that Meyerbeer found
his true vocation, the production of elaborate dramas in
music of the eclectic school. He inaugurated no clearly
defined tendencies in his art; he distinctively belongs to
no national school of music; but his long and important
connection with the French lyric stage classifies him
unmistakably with the composers of this nation.</p>

<p>The subject of this sketch belonged to a family of marked
ability. Jacob Beer was a rich Jewish banker of Berlin,
highly honoured for his robust intellect and scholarly
culture, as well as his wealth. William, one of the sons,
became a distinguished astronomer; another, Michael,
achieved distinction as a dramatic poet; while the eldest,
Jacob, was the composer, who gained his renown under the
Italianised name of Giacomo Meyerbeer, a part of the
surname having been adopted from that of the rich banker
Meyer, who left the musician a great fortune.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meyerbeer</span> was born at Berlin, September 5, 1791, and
was a musical prodigy from his earliest years. When only
four years old he would repeat on the piano the airs he
heard from the hand-organs, composing his own accompaniment.
At five he took lessons of Lanska, a pupil of
Clementi, and at six he made his appearance at a concert.
Three years afterwards the critics spoke of him as one of the
best pianists in Berlin. He studied successively under the
greatest masters of the time, Clementi, Bernhard Anselm
Weber, and Abb&eacute; Vogler. While in the latter&rsquo;s school at
Darmstadt, he had for fellow-pupils Carl von Weber,
Winter, and Gansbacher. Every morning the abb&eacute; called
together his pupils after mass, gave them some theoretical
instruction, then assigned each one a theme for composition.
There was great emulation and friendship between
Meyerbeer and Weber, which afterwards cooled, however,
owing to Weber&rsquo;s disgust at Meyerbeer&rsquo;s lavish catering to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>283]</a></span>
an extravagant taste. Weber&rsquo;s severe and bitter criticisms
were not forgiven by the Franco-German composer.</p>

<p>Meyerbeer&rsquo;s first work was the oratorio &ldquo;Gott und die
Natur,&rdquo; which was performed before the Grand Duke with
such success as to gain for him the appointment of court
composer. Meyerbeer&rsquo;s concerts at Darmstadt and Berlin
were brilliant exhibitions; and Moscheles, no mean judge,
has told us that if Meyerbeer had devoted himself to the
piano, no performer in Europe could have surpassed him.
By advice of Salieri, whom Meyerbeer met in Vienna, he
proceeded to Italy to study the cultivation of the voice; for
he seems in early life to have clearly recognised how
necessary it is for the operatic composer to understand this,
though, in after-years, he treated the voice as ruthlessly in
many of his most important arias and scenas as he would a
brass instrument. He arrived in Vienna just as the
Rossini madness was at its height, and his own blood was
fired to compose operas <i>&agrave; la Rossini</i> for the Italian
theatres. So he proceeded with prodigious industry to
turn out operas. In 1818 he wrote &ldquo;Romilda e Costanza&rdquo;
for Padua; in 1819, &ldquo;Semiramide&rdquo; for Turin; in 1820,
&ldquo;Emma di Resburgo&rdquo; for Venice; in 1822, &ldquo;Margherita
d&rsquo;Anjou&rdquo; for Milan; and in 1823, &ldquo;L&rsquo;Esule di Granata,&rdquo;
also for Milan. These works of the composer&rsquo;s &rsquo;prentice
hand met with the usual fate of the production of the
thousand and one musicians who pour forth operas in
unremitting flow for the Italian theatres; but they were
excellent drill for the future author of &ldquo;Robert le Diable&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Les Huguenots.&rdquo; On returning to Germany Meyerbeer
was very sarcastically criticised on the one side as a
fugitive from the ranks of German music, on the other as
an imitator of Rossini.</p>

<p>Meyerbeer returned to Venice, and in 1824 brought out
&ldquo;Il Crociato in Egitto&rdquo; in that city, an opera which made
the tour of Europe, and established a reputation for the
author as the coming rival of Rossini, no one suspecting
from what Meyerbeer had then accomplished that he was
about to strike boldly out in a new direction. &ldquo;Il
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>284]</a></span>
Crociato&rdquo; was produced in Paris in 1825, and the same
year in London. In the latter city, Velluti, the last of the
male sopranists, was one of the principal singers in the
opera; and it was said by some of the ill-natured critics
that curiosity to see and hear this singer of a peculiar kind,
of whom it was said, &ldquo;Non vir sed Veluti,&rdquo; had as much
to do with the success of the opera as its merits. Lord
Mount-Edgcumbe, however, an excellent critic, wrote of
it &ldquo;as quite of the new school, but not copied from its
founder, Rossini; original, odd, flighty, and it might be
termed fantastic, but at times beautiful. Here and there
most delightful melodies and harmonies occurred, but it
was unequal, solos being as rare as in all the modern
operas.&rdquo; This was the last of Meyerbeer&rsquo;s operas written
in the Italian style.</p>

<p>In 1827 the composer married, and for several years
lived a quiet, secluded life. The loss of his first two
children so saddened him as to concentrate his attention
for a while on church music. During this period he composed
only a &ldquo;Stabat,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Miserere,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Te Deum,&rdquo; and
eight of Klopstock&rsquo;s songs. But he was preparing for that
new departure on which his reputation as a great composer
now rests, and which called forth such bitter condemnation
on the one hand, such thunders of eulogy on the other.
His old fellow-pupil, Weber, wrote of him in after-years&mdash;&ldquo;He
prostituted his profound, admirable, and serious
German talent for the applause of the crowd which he
ought to have despised.&rdquo; And Mendelssohn wrote to his
father in words of still more angry disgust&mdash;&ldquo;When in
&lsquo;Robert le Diable&rsquo; nuns appear one after the other and
endeavour to seduce the hero, till at length the lady abbess
succeeds; when the hero, aided by a magic branch, gains
access to the sleeping apartment of his lady, and throws
her down, forming a tableau which is applauded here, and
will perhaps be applauded in Germany; and when, after
that, she implores for mercy in an aria; when, in another
opera, a girl undresses herself, singing all the while that
she will be married to-morrow, it may be effective, but I find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>285]</a></span>
no music in it. For it is vulgar, and if such is the taste of
the day, and therefore necessary, I prefer writing sacred
music.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Robert le Diable&rdquo; was produced at the Acad&eacute;mie
Royale in 1831, and inaugurated the brilliant reign of Dr.
V&eacute;ron as manager. The bold innovations, the powerful
situations, the daring methods of the composer, astonished
and delighted Paris, and the work was performed more
than a hundred consecutive times. The history of &ldquo;Robert
le Diable&rdquo; is in some respects curious. It was originally
written for the Ventadour Theatre, devoted to comic
opera; but the company were found unable to sing the
difficult music. Meyerbeer was inspired by Weber&rsquo;s &ldquo;Der
Freisch&uuml;tz&rdquo; to attempt a romantic, semi-fantastic legendary
opera, and trod very closely in the footsteps of his model.
It was determined to so alter the libretto and extend and
elaborate the music as to fit it for the stage of the Grand
Opera. MM. Scribe and Delavigne, the librettists, and
Meyerbeer, devoted busy days and nights to hurrying on
the work. The whole opera was remodelled, recitative substituted
for dialogue, and one of the most important
characters, Raimbaud, cut out in the fourth and fifth acts&mdash;a
suppression which is claimed to have befogged a very
clear and intelligible plot. Highly suggestive in its present
state of Weber&rsquo;s opera, the opera of &ldquo;Robert le
Diable&rdquo; is said to have been marvellously similar to &ldquo;Der
Freisch&uuml;tz&rdquo; in the original form, though inferior in dignity
of motive.</p>

<p>Paris was all agog with interest at the first production.
The critics had attended the rehearsals, and it was understood
that the libretto, the music, and the ballet were full
of striking interest. Nourrit played the part of Robert;
Levasseur, Bertram; Mdme. Cinti Damoreau, Isabelle; and
Mdlle. Dorus, Alice. The greatest dancers of the age
were in the ballet, and the brilliant Taglioni led the band
of resuscitated nuns. Habeneck was conductor, and everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>286]</a></span>
had been done in the way of scenery and costumes.
The success was a remarkable one, and Meyerbeer&rsquo;s name
became famous throughout Europe.</p>

<p>Dr. V&eacute;ron, in his <i>M&eacute;moires d&rsquo;un Bourgeois de Paris</i>,
describes a thrilling yet ludicrous accident that occurred
on the first night&rsquo;s performance. After the admirable trio,
which is the <i>d&eacute;no&ucirc;ment</i> of the work, Levasseur, who
personated Bertram, sprang through the trap to rejoin the
kingdom of the dead, whence he came so mysteriously.
Robert, on the other hand, had to remain on the earth,
a converted man, and destined to happiness in marriage
with his princess, Isabelle. Nourrit, the Robert of the
performance, misled by the situation and the fervour of his
own feelings, threw himself into the trap, which was not
properly set. Fortunately the mattresses beneath had not
all been removed, or the tenor would have been killed, a
doom which those on the stage who saw the accident
expected. The audience supposed it was part of the opera,
and the people on the stage were full of terror and lamentation,
when Nourrit appeared to calm their fears. Mdlle.
Dorus burst into tears of joy, and the audience, recognising
the situation, broke into shouts of applause.</p>

<p>The opera was brought out in London the same year,
with nearly the same cast, but did not excite so much
enthusiasm as in Paris. Lord Mount-Edgcumbe, who
represented the connoisseurs of the old school, expressed
the then current opinion of London audiences&mdash;&ldquo;Never
did I see a more disagreeable or disgusting performance.
The sight of the resurrection of a whole convent of nuns,
who rise from their graves and begin dancing like so many
bacchantes, is revolting; and a sacred service in a church,
accompanied by an organ on the stage, not very decorous.
Neither does the music of Meyerbeer compensate for a fable
which is a tissue of nonsense and improbability.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a></p>

<p>M. V&eacute;ron was so delighted with the great success of
&ldquo;Robert&rdquo; that he made a contract with Meyerbeer for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>287]</a></span>
another grand opera, &ldquo;Les Huguenots,&rdquo; to be completed by
a certain date. Meanwhile, the failing health of Mdme.
Meyerbeer obliged the composer to go to Italy, and work
on the opera was deferred, thus causing him to lose thirty
thousand francs as the penalty of his broken contract. At
length, after twenty-eight rehearsals, and an expense of
more than one hundred and sixty thousand francs in
preparation, &ldquo;Les Huguenots&rdquo; was given to the public,
February 26, 1836. Though this great work excited
transports of enthusiasm in Paris, it was interdicted in
many of the cities of Southern Europe on account of the
subject being a disagreeable one to ardent and bigoted
Catholics. In London it has always been the most popular
of Meyerbeer&rsquo;s three great operas, owing perhaps partly to
the singing of Mario and Grisi, and more lately of Titiens
and Giuglini.</p>

<p>When Spontini resigned his place as chapel-master at the
Court of Berlin, in 1832, Meyerbeer succeeded him. He
wrote much music of an accidental character in his new
position, but a slumber seems to have fallen on his greater
creative faculties. The German atmosphere was not
favourable to the fruitfulness of Meyerbeer&rsquo;s genius. He
seems to have needed the volatile and sparkling life of
Paris to excite him into full activity. Or perhaps he was
not willing to produce one of his operas, with their large
dependence on elaborate splendour of production, away
from the Paris Grand Opera. During Meyerbeer&rsquo;s stay in
Berlin he introduced Jenny Lind to the Berlin public, as
he afterwards did indeed to Paris, her <i>d&eacute;but</i> there being
made in the opening performance of &ldquo;Das Feldlager in
Schlesien,&rdquo; afterwards remodelled into &ldquo;L&rsquo;&Eacute;toile du Nord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meyerbeer returned to Paris in 1849, to present the
third of his great operas, &ldquo;La Proph&egrave;te.&rdquo; It was given
with Roger, Viardot-Garcia, and Castellan in the principal
characters. Mdme. Viardot-Garcia achieved one of her
greatest dramatic triumphs in the difficult part of Fides. In
London the opera also met with splendid success, having, as
Chorley tells us, a great advantage over the Paris presentation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>288]</a></span>
in &ldquo;the remarkable personal beauty of Signor Mario,
whose appearance in his coronation robes reminded one of
some bishop-saint in a picture by Van Eyck or D&uuml;rer, and
who could bring to bear a play of feature without grimace
into the scene of false fascination, entirely beyond the
reach of the clever French artist Roger, who originated the
character.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;L&rsquo;&Eacute;toile du Nord&rdquo; was given to the public February
16, 1854. Up to this time the opera of &ldquo;Robert&rdquo; had
been sung three hundred and thirty-three times, &ldquo;Les
Huguenots&rdquo; two hundred and twenty-two, and &ldquo;Le
Proph&egrave;te&rdquo; a hundred and twelve. The &ldquo;Pardon de
Plo&euml;rmel,&rdquo; also known as &ldquo;Dinorah,&rdquo; was offered to the
world of Paris April 4, 1859. Both these operas, though
beautiful, are inferior to his other works.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Meyerbeer, a man of handsome private fortune, like
Mendelssohn, made large sums by his operas, and was
probably the wealthiest of the great composers. He lived
a life of luxurious ease, and yet laboured with intense zeal
a certain number of hours each day. A friend one day
begged him to take more rest, and he answered smilingly,
&ldquo;If I should leave work, I should rob myself of my greatest
pleasure; for I am so accustomed to work that it has
become a necessity.&rdquo; Probably few composers have been
more splendidly rewarded by contemporary fame and
wealth, or been more idolised by their admirers. No less
may it be said that few have been the object of more
severe criticism. His youth was spent amid the severest
classic influences of German music, and the spirit of romanticism
and nationality, which blossomed into such beautiful
and characteristic works as those composed by his friend
and fellow-pupil Weber, also found in his heart an eloquent
echo. But Meyerbeer resolutely disenthralled himself from
what he appeared to have regarded as trammels, and
followed out an ambition to be a cosmopolitan composer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>289]</a></span>
In pursuit of this purpose he divested himself of that fine
flavour of individuality and devotion to art for its own
sake which marks the highest labours of genius. He can
not be exempted from the criticism that he regarded success
and the immediate plaudits of the public as the only satisfactory
rewards of his art. He had but little of the lofty
content which shines out through the vexed and clouded
lives of such souls as Beethoven and Gluck in music, of
Bacon and Milton in literature, who looked forward to
immortality of fame as the best vindication of their work.
A marked characteristic of the man was a secret dissatisfaction
with all that he accomplished, making him
restless and unhappy, and extremely sensitive to criticism.
With this was united a tendency at times to oscillate to
the other extreme of vain-gloriousness. An example of this
was a reply to Rossini one night at the opera when they
were listening to &ldquo;Robert le Diable.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Swan of
Pesaro&rdquo; was a warm admirer of Meyerbeer, though the
latter was a formidable rival, and his works had largely
replaced those of the other in popular repute. Sitting
together in the same box, Rossini, in his delight at one
portion of the opera, cried out in his impulsive Italian way,
&ldquo;If you can write anything to surpass this, I will undertake
to dance upon my head.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Meyerbeer,
&ldquo;you had better soon commence practising, for I
have just commenced the fourth act of &lsquo;Les Huguenots.&rsquo;&rdquo;
Well might he make this boast, for into the fourth act of
his musical setting of the terrible St. Bartholomew tragedy
he put the finest inspirations of his life.</p>

<p>Singular to say, though he himself represented the very
opposite pole of art spirit and method, Mozart was to him
the greatest of his predecessors. Perhaps it was this very
fact, however, which was at the root of his sentiment of
admiration for the composer of &ldquo;Don Giovanni&rdquo; and &ldquo;Le
Nozze di Figaro.&rdquo; A story is told to the effect that Meyerbeer
was once dining with some friends, when a discussion
arose respecting Mozart&rsquo;s position in the musical hierarchy.
Suddenly one of the guests suggested that &ldquo;certain beauties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>290]</a></span>
of Mozart&rsquo;s music had become stale with age. I defy you,&rdquo;
he continued, &ldquo;to listen to &lsquo;Don Giovanni&rsquo; after the
fourth act of the &lsquo;Huguenots.&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;So much the worse,
then, for the fourth act of the &lsquo;Huguenots,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Meyerbeer,
furious at the clumsy compliment paid to his own
work at the expense of his idol.</p>

<p>Critics wedded to the strict German school of music
never forgave Meyerbeer for his dereliction from the spirit
and influences of his nation, and the prominence which he
gave to melodramatic effects and spectacular show in his
operas. Not without some show of reason, they cite this fact
as proof of poverty of musical invention. Mendelssohn, who
was habitually generous in his judgment, wrote to the poet
Immermann from Paris of &ldquo;Robert le Diable&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The subject
is of the romantic order; <i>i.e.</i>, the devil appears in it
(which suffices the Parisians for romance and imagination).
Nevertheless, it is very bad, and, were it not for two brilliant
seduction scenes, there would not even be effect....
The opera does not please me; it is devoid of sentiment
and feeling.... People admire the music, but where there
is no warmth and truth, I cannot even form a standard of
criticism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Schl&uuml;ter, the historian of music, speaks even more bitterly
of Meyerbeer&rsquo;s irreverence and theatric sensationalism&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Les
Huguenots&rsquo; and the far weaker production &lsquo;Le
Proph&egrave;te&rsquo; are, we think, all the more reprehensible (nowadays
especially, when too much stress is laid on the subject
of a work, and consequently on the libretto of an opera),
because the Jew has in these pieces ruthlessly dragged
before the footlights two of the darkest pictures in the
annals of Catholicism, nor has he scrupled to bring high
mass and chorale on the boards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wagner, the last of the great German composers, cannot
find words too scathing and bitter to mark his condemnation
of Meyerbeer. Perhaps his extreme aversion finds
its psychological reason in the circumstance that his own
early efforts were in the sphere of Meyerbeer and Hal&eacute;vy,
and from his present point of view he looks back with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>291]</a></span>
disgust on what he regards as the sins of his youth. The
fairest of the German estimates of the composer, who not
only cast aside the national spirit and methods, but offended
his countrymen by devoting himself to the French stage, is
that of Vischer, an eminent writer on &aelig;sthetics&mdash;&ldquo;Notwithstanding
the composer&rsquo;s remarkable talent for musical
drama, his operas contain sometimes too much, sometimes
too little&mdash;too much in the subject-matter, external adornment,
and effective &lsquo;situations&rsquo;&mdash;too little in the absence
of poetry, ideality, and sentiment (which are essential to a
work of art), as well as in the unnatural and constrained
combinations of the plot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But despite the fact that Meyerbeer&rsquo;s operas contain such
strange scenes as phantom nuns dancing, girls bathing,
sunrise, skating, gunpowder explosions, a king playing the
flute, and the prima donna leading a goat, dramatic music
owes to him new accents of genuine pathos and an addition
to its resources of rendering passionate emotions. Though
much that is merely showy and meretricious there come
frequent bursts of genuine musical power and energy, which
give him a high and unmistakable rank, though he has had
less permanent influence in moulding and directing the
development of musical art than any other composer who
has had so large a place in the annals of his time.</p>

<p>The last twelve years of Meyerbeer&rsquo;s life were spent, with
the exception of brief residences in Germany and Italy, in
Paris, the city of his adoption, where all who were
distinguished in art and letters paid their court to him.
When he was seized with his fatal illness he was hard at
work on &ldquo;L&rsquo;Africaine,&rdquo; for which Scribe had also furnished
the libretto. His heart was set on its completion, and his
daily prayer was that his life might be spared to finish it.
But it was not to be. He died May 2, 1864. The same
morning Rossini called to inquire after the health of the
sick man, equally his friend and rival. When he heard the
sad news he sank into a fit of profound despondency and
grief, from which he did not soon recover. All Paris
mourned with him, and even Germany forgot its critical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>292]</a></span>
dislike to join in regret at the loss of one who, with all his
defects, was so great an artist and so good a man.</p>

<p>Meyerbeer seems to have been greatly afraid of being
buried alive. In his pocket-book after his death was found
a paper giving directions that small bells should be
attached to his hands and feet, and that his body should be
carefully watched for four days, after which it should
be sent to Berlin to be interred by the side of his mother,
to whom he had been most tenderly attached.</p>

<p>The composer was the intimate friend of most of the
celebrities of his time in art and literature. Victor Hugo,
Lamartine, George Sand, Balzac, Alfred de Musset,
Delacroix, Jules Janin, and Th&eacute;ophile Gautier were his
familiar intimates; and the reunions between these and
other gifted men, who then made Paris so intellectually
brilliant, are charmingly described by Liszt and Moscheles.
Meyerbeer&rsquo;s correspondence, which was extensive, deserves
publication, as it displays marked literary faculty, and is
full of bright sympathetic thought, vigorous criticism, and
playful fancy. The following letter to Jules Janin, written
from Berlin a few years before his death, gives some
pleasant insight into his character:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Your last letter was addressed to me at K&ouml;nigsberg; but I was in
Berlin working&mdash;working away like a young man, despite my seventy
years, which somehow certain people, with a peculiar generosity,
try to put upon me. As I am not at K&ouml;nigsberg, where I am to
arrange for the Court concert for the eighteenth of this month, I have
now leisure to answer your letter, and will immediately confess to
you how greatly I was disappointed that you were so little interested
in Rameau; and yet Rameau was always the bright star of your
French opera, as well as your master in the music. He remained
to you after Lulli, and it was he who prepared the way for the
Chevalier Gluck: therefore his family have a right to expect assistance
from the Parisians, who on several occasions have cared for the
descendants of Racine and the grandchildren of the great Corneille.
If I had been in Paris, I certainly would have given two hundred
francs for a seat; and I take this opportunity to beg you to hand that
sum to the poor family, who cannot fail to be unhappy in their
disappointment. At the same time I send you a power of attorney for
M. Guyot, by which I renounce all claims to the parts of my operas
which may be represented at the benefit for the celebrated and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>293]</a></span>
unfortunate Rameau family. Why will you not come to K&ouml;nigsberg
at the festival? Why, in other words, are you not in Berlin? What
splendid music we have in preparation! As to myself, it is not only
a source of pleasure to me, but I feel it a duty, in the position I hold,
to compose a grand march, to be performed at K&ouml;nigsberg while the
royal procession passes from the castle into the church, where the
ceremony of crowning is to take place. I will even compose a hymn,
to be executed on the day that our king and master returns to his
good Berlin. Besides, I have promised to write an overture for the
great concert of the four nations, which the directors of the London
exhibition intend to give at the opening of the same, next spring, in
the Crystal Palace. All this keeps me back: it has robbed me of my
autumn, and will also take a good part of next spring; but with the
help of God, dear friend, I hope we shall see each other again next
year, free from all cares, in the charming little town of Spa, listening
to the babbling of its waters and the rustling of its old grey oaks.</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;Truly your friend,</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Meyerbeer</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Meyerbeer&rsquo;s operas are so intricate in their elements, and
travel so far out of the beaten track of precedent and rule,
that it is difficult to clearly describe their characteristics in
a few words. His original flow of melody could not have
been very rich, for none of his tunes have become household
words, and his excessive use of that element of opera
which has nothing to do with music, as in the case of
Wagner, can have but one explanation. It is in the treatment
of the orchestra that he has added most largely to the
genuine treasures of music. His command of colour in
tone-painting and power of dramatic suggestion have rarely
been equalled, and never surpassed. His genius for musical
rhythm is the most marked element in his power. This is
specially noticeable in his dance music, which is very bold,
brilliant, and voluptuous. The vivacity and grace of the
ballets in his operas save more than one act which otherwise
would be insufferably heavy and tedious. It is not
too much to say that the most spontaneous side of his
creative fancy is found in these affluent, vigorous, and
stirring measures.</p>

<p>Meyerbeer appears always to have been uncertain of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>294]</a></span>
himself and his work. There was little of that masterly
prevision of effect in his mind which is one of the attributes
of the higher imagination. His operas, though most
elaborately constructed, were often entirely modified and
changed in rehearsal, and some of the finest scenes, both in
the dramatic and musical sense, were the outcome of some
happy accidental suggestion at the very last moment.
&ldquo;Robert,&rdquo; &ldquo;Les Huguenots,&rdquo; &ldquo;Le Proph&egrave;te,&rdquo; in the forms
we have them, are quite different from those in which they
were first cast. These operas have therefore been called
&ldquo;the most magnificent patchwork in the history of art,&rdquo;
though this is a harsh phrasing of the fact, which somewhat
outrides justice. Certain it is, however, that Meyerbeer
was largely indebted to the chapter of accidents.</p>

<p>The testimony of Dr. V&eacute;ron, who was manager of the
Grand Opera during the most of the composer&rsquo;s brilliant
career, is of great interest, as illustrating this trait of
Meyerbeer&rsquo;s composition. He tells us in his <i>M&eacute;moires</i>,
before alluded to, that &ldquo;Robert&rdquo; was made and remade
before its final production. The ghastly but effective
colour of the resuscitation scene in the graveyard of the
ruined convent was a change wrought by a stage manager,
who was disgusted with the chorus of simpering women in
the original. This led Meyerbeer to compose the weird
ballet music which is such a characteristic feature of
&ldquo;Robert le Diable.&rdquo; So, too, we are told on the same
authority, the fourth act of &ldquo;Les Huguenots,&rdquo; which is
the most powerful single act in Meyerbeer&rsquo;s operas, owes
its present shape to Nourrit, the most intellectual and
creative tenor singer of whom we have record. It was
originally designed that the St. Bartholomew massacre
should be organised by Queen Marguerite, but Nourrit
pointed out that the interest centering in the heroine,
Valentine, as an involuntary and horrified witness, would
be impaired by the predominance of another female
character. So the plot was largely reconstructed, and
fresh music written. Another still more striking attraction
was the addition of the great duet with which the act now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>295]</a></span>
closes&mdash;a duet which critics have cited as an evidence of
unequalled power, coming as it does at the very heels of
such an astounding chorus as &ldquo;The Blessing of the
Swords.&rdquo; Nourrit felt that the parting of the two lovers
at such a time and place demanded such an outburst and
confession as would be wrung from them by the agony of
the situation. Meyerbeer acted on the suggestion with
such felicity and force as to make it the crowning beauty of
the work. Similar changes are understood to have been
made in &ldquo;Le Proph&egrave;te&rdquo; by advice of Nourrit, whose
poetical insight seems to have been unerring. It was left
to Duprez, Nourrit&rsquo;s successor, however, to be the first
exponent of John of Leyden.</p>

<p>These instances suffice to show how uncertain and
how unequal was the grasp of Meyerbeer&rsquo;s genius, and to
explain in part why he was so prone to gorgeous effects,
aside from that tendency of the Israelitish nature which
delights in show and glitter. We see something in it akin
to the trick of the rhetorician, who seeks to hide poverty of
thought under glittering phrases. Yet Meyerbeer rose to
occasions with a force that was something gigantic. Once
his work was clearly defined in a mind not powerfully
creative, he expressed it in music with such vigour, energy,
and warmth of colour as cannot be easily surpassed. With
this composer there was but little spontaneous flow of
musical thought, clothing itself in forms of unconscious and
perfect beauty, as in the case of Mozart, Beethoven,
Cherubini, Rossini, and others who could be cited. The
constitution of his mind demanded some external power to
bring forth the gush of musical energy.</p>

<p>The operas of Meyerbeer may be best described as highly
artistic and finished mosaic work, containing much that is
precious with much that is false. There are parts of
all his operas which cannot be surpassed for beauty of
music, dramatic energy, and fascination of effect. In
addition, the strength and richness of his orchestration,
which contains original strokes not found in other composers,
give him a lasting claim on the admiration of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>296]</a></span>
lovers of music. No other composer has united so many
glaring defects with such splendid power; and were it not
that Meyerbeer strained his ingenuity to tax the resources
of the singer in every possible way, not even the mechanical
difficulty of producing these operas in a fashion commensurate
with their plan would prevent their taking a
high place among popular operas.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2><a name="gounod" id="gounod"></a><i>GOUNOD.</i></h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Moscheles</span>, one of the severe classical pianists of the
German school, writes as follows, in 1861, in a letter to
a friend&mdash;&ldquo;In Gounod I hail a real composer. I have
heard his &lsquo;Faust&rsquo; both at Leipsic and Dresden, and am
charmed with that refined, piquant music. Critics may
rave if they like against the mutilation of Goethe&rsquo;s masterpiece;
the opera is sure to attract, for it is a fresh,
interesting work, with a copious flow of melody and lovely
instrumentation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henry Chorley in his <i>Thirty Years&rsquo; Musical Recollections</i>,
writing of the year 1851, says&mdash;&ldquo;To a few hearers, since then
grown into a European public, neither the warmest welcome
nor the most bleak indifference could alter the conviction
that among the composers who have appeared during the last
twenty-five years, M. Gounod was the most promising one,
as showing the greatest combination of sterling science,
beauty of idea, freshness of fancy, and individuality.
Before a note of &lsquo;Sappho&rsquo; was written, certain sacred
Roman Catholic compositions and some exquisite settings
of French verse had made it clear to some of the acutest
judges and profoundest musicians living, that in him at last
something true and new had come&mdash;may I not say, the
most poetical of French musicians that has till now
written?&rdquo; The same genial and acute critic, in further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>297]</a></span>
discussing the envy, jealousy, and prejudice that Gounod
awakened in certain musical quarters, writes in still more
decided strains&mdash;&ldquo;The fact has to be swallowed and
digested that already the composer of &lsquo;Sappho,&rsquo; the
choruses to &lsquo;Ulysse,&rsquo; &lsquo;Le M&eacute;decin malgr&eacute; lui,&rsquo; &lsquo;Faust,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Philemon et Baucis,&rsquo; a superb Cecilian mass, two excellent
symphonies, and half a hundred songs and romances, which
may be ranged not far from Schubert&rsquo;s and above any
others existing in France, is one of the very few individuals
left to whom musical Europe is now looking for its
pleasure.&rdquo; Surely it is enough praise for a great musician
that, in the domain of opera, church music, symphony, and
song, he has risen above all others of his time in one
direction, and in all been surpassed by none.</p>

<p>It was not till &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; was produced that Gounod&rsquo;s
genius evinced its highest capacity. For nineteen years
the exquisite melodies of this great work have rung in the
ears of civilisation without losing one whit of the power
with which they first fascinated the lovers of music. The
verdict which the aged Moscheles passed in his Leipsic
home&mdash;Moscheles, the friend of Beethoven, Weber,
Schumann, and Mendelssohn; which was re-echoed by the
patriarchal Rossini, who came from his Passy retirement to
offer his congratulations; which Auber took up again, as
with tears of joy in his eyes he led Gounod, the ex-pupil of
the Conservatory, through the halls wherein had been laid
the foundation of his musical skill&mdash;that verdict has been
affirmed over and over again by the world. For in
&ldquo;Faust&rdquo; we recognise not only some of the most noble
music ever written, but a highly dramatic expression of
spiritual truth. It is hardly a question that Gounod has
succeeded in an unrivalled degree in expressing the characters
and symbolisms of &ldquo;Mephistopheles,&rdquo; &ldquo;Faust,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Gretchen&rdquo; in music not merely beautiful, but spiritual,
humorous, subtile, and voluptuous, accordingly as the
varied meanings of Goethe&rsquo;s masterpiece demand.</p>

<p>Visitors at Paris, while the American civil war was at
its height, might frequently have observed at the beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>298]</a></span>
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Lyrique, afterwards burned by the Vandals of the
Commune, a noticeable-looking man, of blonde complexion
and tawny beard, clear-cut features, and large, bright,
almost sombre-looking eyes. As the opera of &ldquo;Faust&rdquo;
progresses, his features eloquently express his varying
emotions, now of approval, now of annoyance at different
parts of the performance. M. Gounod is criticising the interpretation
of the great opera, which suddenly lifted him
into fame as perhaps the most imaginative and creative of
late composers.</p>

<p>An aggressive disposition, an energy and faith that
accepted no rebuffs, and the power of &ldquo;toiling terribly,&rdquo;
had enabled Gounod to battle his way into the front rank.
Unlike Rossini and Auber, he disdained social recreation,
and was so rarely seen in the fashionable quarters of Paris
and London that only an occasional musical announcement
kept him before the eyes of the public. Gounod seems to
have devoted himself to the strict sphere of his art-life with
an exclusive devotion quite foreign to the general temperament
of the musician, into which something luxurious and
pleasure-loving is so apt to enter. This composer, standing
in the very front rank of his fellows, has injected into the
veins of the French school to which he belongs a seriousness,
depth, and imaginative vigour, which prove to us how
much he is indebted to German inspiration and German
models.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Gounod</span>, born in Paris, June 17, 1818, betrayed
so much passion for music during tender years, that his
father gave him every opportunity to gratify and improve
this marked bias. He studied under Reicha and Le
Sueur, and finally under Hal&eacute;vy, completing under the
latter the preparation which fitted him for entrance into
the Conservatory. The talents he displayed there were
such as to fix on him the attention of his most distinguished
masters. He carried off the second prize at nineteen,
and at twenty-one received the grand prize for musical
composition awarded by the French Institute. His first
published work was a mass performed at the Church
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>299]</a></span>
of St. Eustache, which, while not specially successful, was
sufficiently encouraging to both the young composer and his
friends.</p>

<p>Gounod now proceeded to Rome, where there seems to
have been some inclination on his part to study for holy
orders. But music was not destined to be cheated of so
gifted a votary. In 1841 he wrote a second mass, which
was so well thought of in the papal capital as to gain for
the young composer the appointment of an honorary
chapel-master for life. This recognition of his genius
settled his final conviction that music was his true life-work,
though the religious sentiment, or rather a sympathy
with mysticism, is strikingly apparent in all of his compositions.
The next goal in the composer&rsquo;s art pilgrimage was
the music-loving city of Vienna, the home of Haydn,
Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert, though its people waited
till the last three great geniuses were dead before it
accorded them the loving homage which they have since
so freely rendered. The reception given by the capricious
Viennese to a requiem and a Lenten mass (for as yet
Gounod only thought of sacred music as his vocation) was
not such as to encourage a residence. Paris, the queen
of the world, towards which every French exile ever looks
with longing eyes, seemed to beckon him back; so at the
age of twenty-five he turned his steps again to his beloved
Lutetia. His education was finished; he had completed
his &ldquo;Wanderjahre;&rdquo; and he was eager to enter on the
serious work of life.</p>

<p>He was appointed chapel-master at the Church of Foreign
Missions, in which office he remained for six years, in the
meanwhile marrying a charming woman, the daughter of
Herr Zimmermann, the celebrated theologian and orator.
In 1849 he composed his third mass, which made a powerful
impression on musicians and critics, though Gounod&rsquo;s
ambition, which seems to have been powerfully stimulated
by his marriage, began to realise that it was in the field of
lyric drama only that his powers would find their full
development. He had been an ardent student in literature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>300]</a></span>
and art as well as in music; his style had been formed on
the most noble and serious German models, and his tastes,
awakened into full activity, carried him with great zeal
into the loftier field of operatic composition.</p>

<p>The dominating influence of Gluck, so potent in shaping
the tastes and methods of the more serious French composers,
asserted itself from the beginning in the work of
Gounod, and no modern composer has been so brilliant and
effective a disciple in carrying out the formulas of that
great master. More free, flexible, and melodious than
Spontini and Hal&eacute;vy, measuring his work by a conception
of art more lofty and ideal than that of Meyerbeer, and in
creative power and originality by far their superior,
Gounod&rsquo;s genius, as shown in the one opera of &ldquo;Faust,&rdquo;
suffices to stamp his great mastership.</p>

<p>But he had many years of struggle yet before this end
was to be achieved. His early lyric compositions fell dead.
Score after score was rejected by the managers. No one
cared to hazard the risk of producing an opera by this unknown
composer. His first essay was a pastoral opera,
&ldquo;Philemon and Baucis,&rdquo; and it did not escape from the
manuscript for many a long year, though it has in more
recent times been received by critical German audiences
with great applause. A catalogue of Gounod&rsquo;s failures
would have no significance except as showing that his industry
and energy were not relaxed by public neglect. His
first decided encouragement came in 1851, when &ldquo;Sappho&rdquo;
was produced at the French Opera through the influence of
Madame Pauline Viardot, the sister of Malibran, who had
a generous belief in the composer&rsquo;s future, and such a position
in the musical world of Paris as to make her requests
almost mandatory. This opera, based on the fine poem of
Emile Augier, was well received, and cheered Gounod&rsquo;s
heart to make fresh efforts. In 1852 he composed the
choruses for Poussard&rsquo;s classical tragedy of &ldquo;Ulysse,&rdquo; performed
at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais. The growing recognition
of the world was evidenced in his appointment as director
of the Normal Singing School of Paris, the primary school
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>301]</a></span>
of the Conservatory. In 1854 a five-act opera, with a
libretto from the legend of the &ldquo;Bleeding Nun,&rdquo; was completed
and produced, and Gounod was further gratified to
see that musical authorities were willing to grant him a
distinct place in the ranks of art, though as yet not a very
high one.</p>

<p>For years Gounod&rsquo;s serious and elevated mind had been
pondering on Goethe&rsquo;s great poem as the subject of an
opera, and there is reason to conjecture that parts of it
were composed and arranged, if not fully elaborated, long
prior to its final crystallisation. But he was not yet quite
ready to enter seriously on the composition of the masterpiece.
He must still try his hand on lesser themes. Occasional
pieces for the orchestra or choruses strengthened
his hold on these important elements of lyric composition,
and in 1858 he produced &ldquo;Le M&eacute;decin malgr&eacute; lui,&rdquo; based
on Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s comedy, afterwards performed as an English
opera under the title of &ldquo;The Mock Doctor.&rdquo; Gounod&rsquo;s
genius seems to have had no affinity for the graceful and
sparkling measures of comic music, and his attempt to rival
Rossini and Auber in the field where they were pre-eminent
was decidedly unsuccessful, though the opera contained
much fine music.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The year of his triumph had at last arrived. He had
waited and toiled for years over &ldquo;Faust,&rdquo; and it was now
ready to flash on the world with an electric brightness that
was to make his name instantly famous. One day saw him
an obscure, third-rate composer, the next one of the brilliant
names in art. &ldquo;Faust,&rdquo; first performed 19th March 1859,
fairly took the world by storm. Gounod&rsquo;s warmest friends
were amazed by the beauty of the masterpiece, in which exquisite
melody, great orchestration, and a dramatic passion
never surpassed in operatic art, were combined with a
scientific skill and precision which would vie with that of
the great masters of harmony. Carvalho, the manager of
the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Lyrique, had predicted that the work would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>302]</a></span>
have a magnificent reception by the art world, and lavished
on it every stage resource. Madame Miolan-Carvalho, his
brilliant wife, one of the leading sopranos of the day, sang
the r&ocirc;le of the heroine, though five years afterwards she
was succeeded by Nilsson, who invested the part with a
poetry and tenderness which have never been quite equalled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faust&rdquo; was received at Berlin, Vienna, Milan, St.
Petersburg, and London, with an enthusiasm not less than
that which greeted its Parisian d&eacute;but. The clamour of
dispute between the different schools was for the moment
hushed in the delight with which the musical critics and
public of universal Europe listened to the magical measures
of an opera which to classical chasteness and severity of
form and elevation of motive united such dramatic passion,
richness of melody, and warmth of orchestral colour. From
that day to the present &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; has retained its place as
not only the greatest but the most popular of modern
operas. The proof of the composer&rsquo;s skill and sense of
symmetry in the composition of &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; is shown in the
fact that each part is so nearly necessary to the work, that
but few &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; can be made in presentation without
essentially marring the beauty of the work; and it is therefore
given with close faithfulness to the author&rsquo;s score.</p>

<p>After the immense success of &ldquo;Faust,&rdquo; the doors of the
Academy were opened wide to Gounod. On February 28,
1862, the &ldquo;Reine de Saba&rdquo; was produced, but was only a
<i>succ&egrave;s d&rsquo;estime</i>, the libretto by G&eacute;rard de Nerval not being
fitted for a lyric tragedy.<a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a> Many numbers of this fine
work, however, are still favourites on concert programmes,
and it has been given in English under the name of &ldquo;Irene.&rdquo;
Gounod&rsquo;s love of romantic themes, and the interest in
France which Lamartine&rsquo;s glowing eulogies had excited about
&ldquo;Mireio,&rdquo; the beautiful national poem of the Proven&ccedil;al, M.
Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Mistral, led the former to compose an opera on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>303]</a></span>
libretto from this work, which was given at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre
Lyrique, March 19, 1864, under the name of &ldquo;Mireille.&rdquo;
The music, however, was rather descriptive and lyric than
dramatic, as befitted this lovely ideal of early French
provincial life; and in spite of its containing some of the
most captivating airs ever written, and the fine interpretation
of the heroine by Miolan-Carvalho, it was accepted
with reservations. It has since become more popular in its
three-act form to which it was abridged. It is a tribute to
the essential beauty of Gounod&rsquo;s music that, however unsuccessful
as operas certain of his works have been, they
have all contributed charming <i>morceaux</i> for the enjoyment
of concert audiences. Not only did the airs of &ldquo;Mireille&rdquo;
become public favourites, but its overture is frequently given
as a distinct orchestral work.</p>

<p>The opera of &ldquo;La Colombe,&rdquo; known in English as &ldquo;The
Pet Dove,&rdquo; followed in 1866; and the next year was produced
the five-act opera of &ldquo;Rom&eacute;o et Juliette,&rdquo; of which
the principal part was again taken by Madame Miolan-Carvalho.
The favourite pieces in this work, which is a
highly poetic rendering of Shakespeare&rsquo;s romantic tragedy,
are the song of <i>Queen Mab</i>, the garden duet, a short chorus
in the second act, and the duel scene in the third act. For
some occult reason, &ldquo;Rom&eacute;o et Juliette,&rdquo; though recognised
as a work of exceptional beauty and merit, and still occasionally
performed, has no permanent hold on the operatic public
of to-day.</p>

<p>The evils that fell on France from the German war and
the horrors of the Commune drove Gounod to reside in
London, unlike Auber, who resolutely refused to forsake the
city of his love, in spite of the suffering and privation which
he foresaw, and which were the indirect cause of the veteran
composer&rsquo;s death. Gounod remained several years in England,
and lived a retired life, seemingly as if he shrank
from public notice and disdained public applause. His
principal appearances were at the Philharmonic, the Crystal
Palace, and at Mrs. Weldon&rsquo;s concerts, where he directed the
performances of his own compositions. The circumstances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>304]</a></span>
of his London residence seem to have cast a cloud over
Gounod&rsquo;s life and to have strangely unsettled his mind.
Patriotic grief probably had something to do with this at
the outset. But even more than this as a source of
permanent irritation may be reckoned the spell cast over
Gounod&rsquo;s mind by a beautiful adventuress, who was ambitious
to attain social and musical recognition through the
<i>&eacute;clat</i> of the great composer&rsquo;s friendship. Though newspaper
report may be credited with swelling and distorting the
naked facts, enough appears to be known to make it sure
that the evil genius of Gounod&rsquo;s London life was a woman,
who traded recklessly with her own reputation and the
French composer&rsquo;s fame.</p>

<p>However untoward the surroundings of Gounod, his genius
did not lie altogether dormant during this period of friction
and fretfulness, conditions so repressive to the best imaginative
work. He composed several masses and other church
music; a &ldquo;Stabat Mater&rdquo; with orchestra; the oratorio of
&ldquo;Tobie&rdquo;; &ldquo;Gallia,&rdquo; a lamentation for France; incidental
music for Legouv&eacute;&rsquo;s tragedy of &ldquo;Les Deux Reines,&rdquo; and
for Jules Barbier&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc;&rdquo; a large number of
songs and romances, both sacred and secular, such as
&ldquo;Nazareth,&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is a Green Hill;&rdquo; and orchestral
works, &ldquo;Salterello in A,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Funeral March of a
Marionette.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last he broke loose from the bonds of Delilah, and,
remembering that he had been elected to fill the place of
Clapisson in the Institute, he returned to Paris in 1876 to
resume the position which his genius so richly deserved.
On the 5th of March of the following year his &ldquo;Cinq-Mars&rdquo;
was brought out at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de l&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra Comique;
but it showed the traces of the haste and carelessness with
which it was written, and therefore commanded little more
than a respectful hearing. His last opera, &ldquo;Polyeucte,&rdquo;
produced at the Grand Opera, October 7, 1878, though
credited with much beautiful music, and nobly orchestrated,
is not regarded by the French critics as likely to add
anything to the reputation of the composer of &ldquo;Faust.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>305]</a></span>
Gounod, now at the age of sixty, if we judge him by the
prolonged fertility of so many of the great composers, may
be regarded as not having largely passed the prime of his
powers. The world still has a right to expect much from
his genius. Conceded even by his opponents to be a great
musician and a thorough master of the orchestra, more
generous critics in the main agree to rank Gounod as the
most remarkable contemporary composer, with the possible
exception of Richard Wagner. The distinctive trait of his
dramatic conceptions seems to be an imagination hovering
between sensuous images and mystic dreams. Originally
inspired by the severe Greek sculpture of Gluck&rsquo;s music,
he has applied that master&rsquo;s laws in the creation of tone-pictures
full of voluptuous colour, but yet solemnised at
times by an exaltation which recalls the time when as a
youth he thought of the spiritual dignity of priesthood.
The use he makes of his religious reminiscences is
familiarly illustrated in &ldquo;Faust.&rdquo; The contrast between
two opposing principles is marked in all of Gounod&rsquo;s
dramatic works, and in &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; this struggle of &ldquo;a soul
which invades mysticism and which still seeks to express
voluptuousness&rdquo; not only colours the music with a novel
fascination, but amounts to an interesting psychological
problem.</p>

It has been a matter of frequent comment by the ablest musical
critics that many noble operas, now never heard, would have retained
their place in the repertoires of modern dramatic music, had it not
been for the utter rubbish to which the music has been set.</p>
</div>
</div>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Gounod&rsquo;s genius fills too large a space in contemporary
music to be passed over without a brief special study. In
pursuit of this no better method suggests itself than an
examination of the opera of &ldquo;Faust,&rdquo; into which the
composer poured the finest inspirations of his life, even as
Goethe embodied the sum and flower of his long career,
which had garnered so many experiences, in his poetic
masterpiece.</p>

<p>The story of &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; has tempted many composers.
Prince Radziwill tried it, and then Spohr set a version of
the theme at once coarse and cruel, full of vulgar witchwork
and love-making only fit for a chambermaid. Since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>306]</a></span>
then Schumann, Liszt, Wagner, and Berlioz have treated
the story orchestrally with more or less success. Gounod&rsquo;s
treatment of the poem is by far the most intelligible,
poetic, and dramatic ever attempted, and there is no opera
since the days of Gluck with so little weak music, except
Beethoven&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fidelio.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the introduction the restless gloom of the old
philosopher and the contrasted joys of youth engaged in
rustic revelry outside are expressed with graphic force; and
the Kirmes music in the next act is so quaint and original,
as well as melodious, as to give the sense of delightful
comedy. When Marguerite enters on the scene, we have a
waltz and chorus of such beauty and piquancy as would
have done honour to Mozart. Indeed, in the dramatic use
of dance music Gounod hardly yields in skill and originality
to Meyerbeer himself, though the latter composer specially
distinguished himself in this direction. The third and
fourth acts develop all the tenderness and passion of
Marguerite&rsquo;s character, all the tragedy of her doom.</p>

<p>After Faust&rsquo;s beautiful monologue in the garden come the
song of the &ldquo;King of Thule&rdquo; and Marguerite&rsquo;s delight at
finding the jewels, which conjoined express the artless
vanity of the child in a manner alike full of grace and
pathos. The quartet that follows is one of great beauty,
the music of each character being thoroughly in keeping,
while the admirable science of the composer blends all into
thorough artistic unity. It is hardly too much to assert
that the love scene which closes this act has nothing to
surpass it for fire, passion, and tenderness, seizing the mind
of the hearer with absorbing force by its suggestion and
imagery, while the almost cloying sweetness of the melody
is such as Rossini and Schubert only could equal. The full
confession of the enamoured pair contained in the brief
<i>adagio</i> throbs with such rapture as to find its most suggestive
parallel in the ardent words commencing</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Gallop apace, ye fiery-footed steeds,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>placed by Shakespeare in the mouth of the expectant Juliet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>307]</a></span>
Beauties succeed each other in swift and picturesque
succession, fitting the dramatic order with a nicety which
forces the highest praise of the critic. The march and the
chorus marking the return of Valentine&rsquo;s regiment beat
with a fire and enthusiasm to which the tramp of victorious
squadrons might well keep step. The wicked music of
Mephistopheles in the sarcastic serenade, the powerful duel
trio, and Valentine&rsquo;s curse are of the highest order of
expression; while the church scene, where the fiend
whispers his taunts in the ear of the disgraced Marguerite, as
the gloomy musical hymn and peals of the organ menace
her with an irreversible doom, is a weird and thrilling
picture of despair, agony, and devilish exultation.</p>

<p>Gounod has been blamed for violating the reverence due
to sacred things, employing portions of the church service
in this scene, instead of writing music for it. But this is
the last resort of critical hostility, seeking a peg on which
to hang objection. Meyerbeer&rsquo;s splendid introduction of
Luther&rsquo;s great hymn, &ldquo;Ein&rsquo; feste Burg,&rdquo; in &ldquo;Les
Huguenots,&rdquo; called forth a similar criticism from his
German assailants. Some of the most dramatic effects in
music have been created by this species of musical quotation,
so rich in its appeal to memory and association. Who
that has once heard can forget the thrilling power of &ldquo;La
Marseillaise&rdquo; in Schumann&rsquo;s setting of Heinrich Heine&rsquo;s
poem of &ldquo;The Two Grenadiers?&rdquo; The two French
soldiers, weary and broken-hearted after the Russian
campaign, approach the German frontier. The veterans are
moved to tears as they think of their humiliated Emperor.
Up speaks one suffering with a deadly hurt to the other,
&ldquo;Friend, when I am dead, bury me in my native France,
with my cross of honour on my breast, and my musket in
my hand, and lay my good sword by my side.&rdquo; Until this
time the melody has been a slow and dirge-like stave in the
minor key. The old soldier declares his belief that he will
rise again from the clods when he hears the victorious
tramp of his Emperor&rsquo;s squadrons passing over his grave,
and the minor breaks into a weird setting of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>308]</a></span>
&ldquo;Marseillaise&rdquo; in the major key. Suddenly it closes with
a few solemn chords, and, instead of the smoke of battle
and the march of the phantom host, the imagination sees
the lonely plain with its green mounds and mouldering
crosses.</p>

<p>Readers will pardon this digression illustrating an
artistic law, of which Gounod has made such effective use
in the church scene of his &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; in heightening its tragic
solemnity. The wild goblin symphony in the fifth act has
added some new effects to the gamut of deviltry in music,
and shows that Weber in the &ldquo;Wolf&rsquo;s Glen&rdquo; and
Meyerbeer in the &ldquo;Cloisters of St. Rosalie&rdquo; did not
exhaust the somewhat limited field. The whole of this
part of the act, sadly mutilated and abridged often in
representation, is singularly picturesque and striking as
a musical conception, and is a fitting companion to the
tragic prison scene. The despair of the poor crazed
Marguerite; her delirious joy in recognising Faust; the
temptation to fly; the final outburst of faith and hope, as
the sense of Divine pardon sinks into her soul&mdash;all these
are touched with the fire of genius, and the passion sweeps
with an unfaltering force to its climax. These references
to the details of a work so familiar as &ldquo;Faust,&rdquo; conveying
of course no fresh information to the reader, have been
made to illustrate the peculiarities of Gounod&rsquo;s musical
temperament, which sways in such fascinating contrast
between the voluptuous and the spiritual. But whether
his accents belong to the one or the other, they bespeak
a mood flushed with earnestness and fervour, and a mind
which recoils from the frivolous, however graceful it may
be.</p>

<p>In the Franco-German school, of which Gounod is so
high an exponent, the orchestra is busy throughout developing
the history of the emotions, and in &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; especially
it is as busy a factor in expressing the passions of the
characters as the vocal parts. Not even in the &ldquo;garden
scene&rdquo; does the singing reduce the instruments to a
secondary importance. The difference between Gounod
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>309]</a></span>
and Wagner, who professes to elaborate the importance of
the orchestra in dramatic music, is that the former has a
skill in writing for the voice which the other lacks. The
one lifts the voice by the orchestration, the other submerges
it. Gounod&rsquo;s affluence of lovely melody can only be
compared with that of Mozart and Rossini, and his skill
and ingenuity in treating the orchestra have wrung
reluctant praise from his bitterest opponents.</p>

<p>The special power which makes Gounod unique in his
art, aside from those elements before alluded to as derived
from temperament, is his unerring sense of dramatic fitness,
which weds such highly suggestive music to each varying
phase of character and action. To this perhaps one exception
may be made. While he possesses a certain airy
playfulness, he fails in rich broad humour utterly, and
situations of comedy are by no means so well handled as
the more serious scenes. A good illustration of this may
be found in the &ldquo;Le M&eacute;decin malgr&eacute; lui,&rdquo; in the couplets
given to the drunken &ldquo;Sganarelle.&rdquo; They are beautiful
music, but utterly unflavoured with the <i>vis comica</i>.</p>

<p>Had Gounod written only &ldquo;Faust,&rdquo; it should stamp him
as one of the most highly-gifted composers of his age.
Noticeably in his other works, pre-eminently in this, he
has shown a melodic freshness and fertility, a mastery of
musical form, a power of orchestration, and a dramatic
energy, which are combined to the same degree in no one
of his rivals. Therefore it is just to place him in the first
rank of contemporary composers.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Note by the Editor.</span>&mdash;Gounod is a strongly religious man, and
more than once has been on the point of entering the Church. It is,
therefore, not surprising that he should have in his later life turned his
attention to the finest form of sacred music, the oratorio. His first
and greatest work of this class is his &ldquo;Redemption,&rdquo; produced at the
Birmingham Festival of 1882, and conducted by himself. It was well
received, and has met with success at all subsequent performances. It
is intended to illustrate &ldquo;three great facts (to quote the composer&rsquo;s
words in his prefatory commentary) on which the existence of the
Christian Church depends.... The Passion and death of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>310]</a></span>
Saviour, His glorious life on earth from His resurrection to His
Ascension, and finally the spread of Christianity in the world through
the mission of the apostles. These three parts of the present trilogy are
preceded by a Prologue on the Creation and Fall of our first parents,
and the promise of the Redeemer.&rdquo; In this work Gounod has discarded
the polyphonic method of the previous school of Italian and German
sacred music, and adopted the dramatic treatment. A competent critic
has written of this work in the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;The &lsquo;Redemption&rsquo;
may be classed among its author&rsquo;s noblest productions. It is a work
of high aim, written regardless of immediate popularity, and therefore
all the more likely to take rank among the permanent additions which
sacred music owes to modern music.&rdquo; In 1885 the oratorio of &ldquo;Mors
et Vita&rdquo; was produced at the Birmingham Festival, conducted by Herr
Richter. Though well received, it did not make as great an impression
as its predecessor, to which it stands in the light of a sequel. It
consists of four parts&mdash;a short Prologue, a Requiem Mass, the Last
Judgment, and Judex (or the Celestial City). In the Prologue a
special <i>leitmotive</i> accompanying the words &ldquo;Horrendum est in incidere
in Manus Dei&rdquo; signifies the Death, not only of the body, but of the
unredeemed soul. A gleam of hope, however, pierces the darkness,
and a beautiful theme is heard frequently throughout the work expressive
of &ldquo;the idea of justice tempered with mercy, and finally the
happiness of the blessed. The two opposing forces of the design, <i>Mors</i>
and <i>Vita</i>, are thus well defined.&rdquo; The work, however, is unequal;
the Requiem Mass, in particular, does not rise in importance when
compared with the many fine examples of the Italian and German
sacred music which preceded it. &ldquo;Compared with that truly inspired
work, &lsquo;Redemption,&rsquo; partly written, it should be remembered, more
than ten years previously, Gounod&rsquo;s new effort shows a distinct decline,
especially as regards unity of style and genuine inspiration.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2><a name="berlioz" id="berlioz"></a><i>BERLIOZ.</i></h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the long list of brilliant names which have illustrated
the fine arts, there is none attached to a personality more
interesting and impressive than that of Hector Berlioz.
He stands solitary, a colossus in music, with but few
admirers and fewer followers. Original, puissant in faculties,
fiercely dogmatic and intolerant, bizarre, his influence
has impressed itself profoundly on the musical world both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>311]</a></span>
for good and evil, but has failed to make disciples or to
rear a school. Notwithstanding the defects and extravagances
of Berlioz, it is safe to assert that no art or philosophy
can boast of an example of more perfect devotion to
an ideal. The startling originality of Berlioz as a musician
rests on a mental and emotional organisation different from
and in some respects superior to that of any other eminent
master. He possessed an ardent temperament; a gorgeous
imagination, that knew no rest in its working, and at times
became heated to the verge of madness; a most subtile sense
of hearing; an intellect of the keenest analytic turn; a
most arrogant will, full of enterprise and daring, which
clung to its purpose with unrelenting tenacity; and
passions of such heat and fervour that they rarely failed
when aroused to carry him beyond all bounds of reason.
His genius was unique, his character cast in the mould of a
Titan, his life a tragedy. Says Blaze de Bussy&mdash;&ldquo;Art has
its martyrs, its forerunners crying in the wilderness, and
feeding on roots. It has also its spoiled children sated
with bonbons and dainties.&rdquo; Berlioz belongs to the former
of these classes, and, if ever a prophet lifted up his voice
with a vehement and incessant outcry, it was he.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hector Berlioz</span> was born on December 11, 1803, at C&ocirc;te
Saint Andr&eacute;, a small town between Grenoble and Lyons.
His father was an excellent physician of more than ordinary
attainments, and he superintended his son&rsquo;s studies with
great zeal, in the hope that the lad would also become an
ornament of the healing profession. But young Hector,
though an excellent scholar in other branches, developed a
special aptitude for music, and at twelve he could sing at
sight, and play difficult concertos on the flute. The elder
regarded music only as a graceful ornament to life, and in
nowise encouraged his son in thinking of music as a
profession. So it was not long before Hector found his
attention directed to anatomy, physiology, osteology, etc.
In his father&rsquo;s library he had already read of Gluck,
Haydn, Mozart, etc., and had found a manuscript score of
an opera which he had committed to memory. His soul
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>312]</a></span>
revolted more and more from the path cut out for him.
&ldquo;Become a physician!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;study anatomy; dissect;
take part in horrible operations? No! no! That would
be a total subversion of the natural course of my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But parental resolution carried the day, and, after he had
finished the preliminary course of study, he was ordered up
to Paris to join the army of medical students. So at the
age of nineteen we find him lodged in the Quartier Latin.
His first introduction to medical studies had been unfortunate.
On entering a dissecting-room he had been so
convulsed with horror as to leap from the window, and rush
to his lodgings in an agony of dread and disgust, whence he
did not emerge for twenty-four hours. At last, however,
by dint of habit he became somewhat used to the disagreeable
facts of his new life, and, to use his own words, &ldquo;bade
fair to add one more to the army of bad physicians,&rdquo; when
he went to the opera one night and heard &ldquo;Les Dana&iuml;des,&rdquo;
Salieri&rsquo;s opera, performed with all the splendid completeness
of the Acad&eacute;mie Royale. This awakened into fresh
life an unquenchable thirst for music, and he neglected his
medical studies for the library of the Conservatoire, where
he learned by heart the scores of Gluck and Rameau. At
last, on coming out one night from a performance of
&ldquo;Iphig&eacute;nie,&rdquo; he swore that henceforth music should have
her divine rights of him, in spite of all and everything.
Henceforth hospital, dissecting-room, and professor&rsquo;s lectures
knew him no more.</p>

<p>But to get admission to the Conservatoire was now the
problem; Berlioz set to work on a cantata with orchestral
accompaniments, and in the meantime sent the most imploring
letters home asking his father&rsquo;s sanction for this change
of life. The inexorable parent replied by cutting off his
son&rsquo;s allowance, saying that he would not help him to
become one of the miserable herd of unsuccessful musicians.
The young enthusiast&rsquo;s cantata gained him admission to the
classes of Le Sueur and Reicha at the Conservatoire, but
alas! dire poverty stared him in the face. The history of
his shifts and privations for some months is a sad one. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>313]</a></span>
slept in an old, unfurnished garret, and shivered under
insufficient bed-clothing, ate his bread and grapes on the
Pont Neuf, and sometimes debated whether a plunge into
the Seine would not be the easiest way out of it all. No
mongrel cur in the capital but had a sweeter bone to crunch
than he. But the young fellow for all this stuck to his
work with dogged tenacity, managed to get a mass performed
at St. Roch church, and soon finished the score of
an opera, &ldquo;Les Francs Juges.&rdquo; Flesh and blood would
have given way at last under this hard diet, if he had not
obtained a position in the chorus of the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre des
Noveauteaus. Berlioz gives an amusing account of his
going to compete with the horde of applicants&mdash;butchers,
bakers, shop-apprentices, etc.&mdash;each one with his roll of
music under his arm.</p>

<p>The manager scanned the raw-boned starveling with a
look of wonder. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your music?&rdquo; quoth the tyrant
of a third-class theatre. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any, I can sing
anything you can give me at sight,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;The
devil!&rdquo; rejoined the manager; &ldquo;but we haven&rsquo;t any music
here.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, what do you want?&rdquo; said Berlioz. &ldquo;I
sing every note of all the operas of Gluck, Piccini, Salieri,
Rameau, Spontini, Gr&eacute;try, Mozart, and Cimarosa, from
memory.&rdquo; At hearing this amazing declaration, the rest of
the competitors slunk away abashed, and Berlioz, after singing
an aria from Spontini, was accorded the place, which
guaranteed him fifty francs per month&mdash;a pittance, indeed,
and yet a substantial addition to his resources. This pot-boiling
connection of Berlioz was never known to the public
till after he became a distinguished man, though he was
accustomed to speak in vague terms of his early dramatic
career as if it were a matter of romantic importance.</p>

<p>At last, however, he was relieved of the necessity of
singing on the stage to amuse the Paris <i>bourgeoisie</i>, and in
a singular fashion. He had been put to great straits to get
his first work, which had won him his way into the Conservatoire,
performed. An application to the great Chateaubriand,
who was noted for benevolence, had failed, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>314]</a></span>
author of <i>La G&eacute;nie de Christianisme</i> was then almost as
poor as Berlioz. At last a young friend, De Pons, advanced
him twelve hundred francs. Part of this Berlioz had repaid,
but the creditor, put to it for money, wrote to Berlioz
<i>p&egrave;re</i>, demanding a full settlement of the debt. The father
was thus brought again into communication with his son,
whom he found nearly sick unto death with a fever. His
heart relented, and the old allowance was resumed again,
enabling the young musician to give his whole time to his
beloved art, instantly he convalesced from his illness.</p>

<p>The eccentric ways and heretical notions of Berlioz made
him no favourite with the dons of the Conservatoire, and
by the irritable and autocratic Cherubini he was positively
hated. The young man took no pains to placate this
resentment, but on the other hand elaborated methods of
making himself doubly offensive. His power of stinging
repartee stood him in good stead, and he never put a
button on his foil. Had it been in old Cherubini&rsquo;s power
to expel this bold pupil from the Conservatoire, no scruple
would have held him back. But the genius and industry
of Berlioz were undeniable, and there was no excuse for
such extreme measures. Prejudiced as were his judges, he
successively took several important prizes.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Berlioz&rsquo;s happiest evenings were at the Grand Opera,
for which he prepared himself by solemn meditation. At
the head of a band of students and amateurs, he took on
himself the right of the most outspoken criticism, and led
the enthusiasm or the condemnation of the audience. At
this time Beethoven was barely tolerated in Paris, and the
great symphonist was ruthlessly clipped and shorn to
suit the French taste, which pronounced him &ldquo;bizarre, incoherent,
diffuse, bustling with rough modulations and
wild harmonies, destitute of melody, forced in expression,
noisy, and fearfully difficult,&rdquo; even as England at the same
time frowned down his immortal works as &ldquo;obstreperous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>315]</a></span>
roarings of modern frenzy.&rdquo; Berlioz&rsquo;s clear, stern voice
would often be heard, when liberties were taken with the
score, loud above the din of the instruments. &ldquo;What
wretch has dared to tamper with the great Beethoven?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Who has taken upon him to revise Gluck?&rdquo; This self-appointed
arbiter became the dread of the operatic management,
for, as a pupil of the Conservatoire, he had some
rights which could not be infringed.</p>

<p>Berlioz composed some remarkable works while at the
Conservatoire, amongst which were the &ldquo;Ouverture des
Francs Juges,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Symphonie Fantastique,&rdquo; and in
many ways indicated that the bent of his genius had fully
declared itself. His decided and indomitable nature disdained
to wear a mask, and he never sugar-coated his
opinion, however unpalatable to others. He was already
in a state of fierce revolt against the conventional forms of
the music of his day, and no trumpet-tones of protest were
too loud for him. He had now begun to write for the
journals, though oftentimes his articles were refused on
account of their fierce assaults. &ldquo;Your hands are too full
of stones, and there are too many glass windows about,&rdquo;
was the excuse of one editor, softening the return of a
manuscript. But Berlioz did not fully know himself or
appreciate the tendencies fermenting within him until in
1830 he became the victim of a grand Shakespearean
passion. The great English dramatist wrought most
powerfully on Victor Hugo and Hector Berlioz, and had
much to do with their artistic development. Berlioz gives
a very interesting account of his Shakespearean enthusiasm,
which also involved one of the catastrophes of his own
personal life. &ldquo;An English company gave some plays of
Shakespeare, at that time wholly unknown to the French
public. I went to the first performance of &lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; at
the Od&eacute;on. I saw, in the part of Ophelia, Harriet Smithson,
who became my wife five years afterwards. The effect of
her prodigious talent, or rather of her dramatic genius,
upon my heart and imagination, is only comparable to
the complete overturning which the poet, whose worthy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>316]</a></span>
interpreter she was, caused in me. Shakespeare, thus coming
on me suddenly, struck me as with a thunderbolt. His
lightning opened the heaven of art to me with a sublime
crash, and lighted up its farthest depths. I recognised
true dramatic grandeur, beauty, and truth. I measured at
the same time the boundless inanity of the notions of
Shakespeare in France, spread abroad by Voltaire.</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Chez l&rsquo;homme en mission par le diable envoy&eacute;&mdash;&rsquo;<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p>(&lsquo;that ape of genius, an emissary from the devil to man&rsquo;),
and the pitiful poverty of our old poetry of pedagogues and
ragged-school teachers. I saw, I understood, I felt that I
was alive and must arise and walk.&rdquo; Of the influence of
&ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; on him, he says, &ldquo;Exposing myself
to the burning sun and balmy nights of Italy, seeing this
love as quick and sudden as thought, burning like lava,
imperious, irresistible, boundless, and pure and beautiful as
the smile of angels, those furious scenes of vengeance, those
distracted embraces, those struggles between love and
death, was too much. After the melancholy, the gnawing
anguish, the tearful love, the cruel irony, the sombre meditations,
the heart-rackings, the madness, tears, mourning, the
calamities and sharp cleverness of Hamlet; after the
grey clouds and icy winds of Denmark; after the third act,
hardly breathing, in pain as if a hand of iron were
squeezing at my heart, I said to myself with the fullest
conviction, &lsquo;Ah! I am lost.&rsquo; I must add that I did not
at that time know a word of English, that I only caught
glimpses of Shakespeare through the fog of Letourneur&rsquo;s
translation, and that I consequently could not perceive the
poetic web that surrounds his marvellous creations like a
net of gold. I have the misfortune to be very nearly in
the same sad case to-day. It is much harder for a Frenchman
to sound the depths of Shakespeare than for an
Englishman to feel the delicacy and originality of La
Fontaine or Moli&egrave;re. Our two poets are rich continents;
Shakespeare is a world. But the play of the actors, above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>317]</a></span>
all of the actress, the succession of the scenes, the pantomime
and the accent of the voices, meant more to me, and
filled me a thousand times more with Shakespearean ideas
and passion than the text of my colourless and unfaithful
translation. An English critic said last winter in the
<i>Illustrated London News</i>, that, after seeing Miss Smithson
in Juliet, I had cried out, &lsquo;I will marry that woman and
write my grandest symphony on this play.&rsquo; I did both,
but never said anything of the sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The beautiful Miss Smithson became the rage, the inspiration
of poets and painters, the idol of the hour, at whose
feet knelt all the <i>rou&eacute;s</i> and rich idlers of the town.
Delacroix painted her as the Ophelia of his celebrated
picture, and the English company made nearly as much
sensation in Paris as the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise recently aroused
in London. Berlioz&rsquo;s mind, perturbed and inflamed with
the mighty images of the Shakespearean world, swept with
wide, powerful passion towards Shakespeare&rsquo;s interpreter.
He raged and stormed with his accustomed vehemence,
made no secret of his infatuation, and walked the streets at
night, calling aloud the name of the enchantress, and cooling
his heated brows with many a sigh. He, too, would prove
that he was a great artist, and his idol should know that
she had no unworthy lover. He would give a concert, and
Miss Smithson should be present by hook or by crook. He
went to Cherubini and asked permission to use the great
hall of the Conservatoire, but was churlishly refused.
Berlioz, however, managed to secure the concession over the
head of Cherubini, and advertised his concert. He went to
large expense in copyists, orchestra, solo-singers, and chorus,
and, when the night came, was almost fevered with expectation.
But the concert was a failure, and the adored one
was not there; she had not even heard of it! The disappointment
nearly laid the young composer on a bed of
sickness; but, if he oscillated between deliriums of hope
and despair, his powerful will was also full of elasticity, and
not for long did he even rave in the utter ebb of disappointment.
Throughout the whole of his life, Berlioz displayed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>318]</a></span>
this swiftness of recoil; one moment crazed with grief and
depression, the next he would bend to his labour with a cool,
steady fixedness of purpose, which would sweep all interferences
aside like cobwebs. But still, night after night, he
would haunt the Od&eacute;on, and drink in the sights and sounds
of the magic world of Shakespeare, getting fresh inspiration
nightly for his genius and love. If he paid dearly for this
rich intellectual acquaintance by his passion for La Belle
Smithson, he yet gained impulses and suggestions for his
imagination, ravenous of new impressions, which wrought
deeply and permanently. Had Berlioz known the outcome,
he would not have bartered for immunity by losing the
jewels and ingots of the Shakespeare treasure-house.</p>

<p>The year 1830 was for Berlioz one of alternate exaltation
and misery; of struggle, privation, disappointment; of all
manner of torments inseparable from such a volcanic temperament
and restless brain. But he had one consolation
which gratified his vanity. He gained the Prix de Rome
by his cantata of &ldquo;Sardanapalus.&rdquo; This honour had a
practical value also. It secured him an annuity of three
thousand francs for a period of five years, and two years&rsquo;
residence in Italy. Berlioz would never let &ldquo;well enough&rdquo;
alone, however. He insisted on adding an orchestral part
to the completed score, describing the grand conflagration of
the palace of Sardanapalus. When the work was produced,
it was received with a howl of sarcastic derision, owing
to the latest whim of the composer. So Berlioz started for
Italy, smarting with rage and pain, as if the Furies were
lashing him with their scorpion whips.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The pensioners of the Conservatoire lived at Rome in the
Villa Medici, and the illustrious painter, Horace Vernet,
was the director, though he exercised but little supervision
over the studies of the young men under his nominal charge.
Berlioz did very much as he pleased&mdash;studied little or much
as the whim seized him, visited the churches, studios, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>319]</a></span>
picture-galleries, and spent no little of his time by starlight
and sunlight roaming about the country adjacent to the
Holy City in search of adventures. He had soon come to
the conclusion that he had not much to learn of Italian
music; that he could teach rather than be taught. He
speaks of Roman art with the bitterest scorn, and Wagner
himself never made a more savage indictment of Italian
music than does Berlioz in his <i>M&eacute;moires</i>. At the theatres
he found the orchestra, dramatic unity, and common sense
all sacrificed to mere vocal display. At St. Peter&rsquo;s and
the Sistine Chapel religious earnestness and dignity were
frittered away in pretty part-singing, in mere frivolity and
meretricious show. The word &ldquo;symphony&rdquo; was not known
except to indicate an indescribable noise before the rising of
the curtain. Nobody had heard of Weber and Beethoven,
and Mozart, dead more than a score of years, was mentioned
by a well-known musical connoisseur as a young man of
great promise! Such surroundings as these were a species
of purgatory to Berlioz, against whose bounds he fretted
and raged without intermission. The director&rsquo;s receptions
were signalised by the performance of insipid cavatinas, and
from these, as from his companions&rsquo; revels, in which he would
sometimes indulge with the maddest debauchery as if to kill
his own thoughts, he would escape to wander in the majestic
ruins of the Coliseum and see the magic Italian moonlight
shimmer through its broken arches, or stroll on the lonely
Campagna till his clothes were drenched with dew. No
fear of the deadly Roman malaria could check his restless
excursions, for, like a fiery horse, he was irritated to madness
by the inaction of his life. To him the <i>dolce far niente</i> was
a meaningless phrase. His comrades scoffed at him and
called him &ldquo;<i>P&egrave;re la Joie</i>,&rdquo; in derision of the fierce melancholy
which despised them, their pursuits and pleasures.</p>

<p>At the end of the year he was obliged to present something
before the Institute as a mark of his musical advancement,
and he sent on a fragment of his &ldquo;Mass&rdquo; heard
years before at St. Roch, in which the wise judges professed
to find the &ldquo;evidences of material advancement, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>320]</a></span>
total abandonment of his former reprehensible tendencies.&rdquo;
One can fancy the scornful laughter of Berlioz at hearing
this verdict. But his Italian life was not altogether
purposeless. He revised his &ldquo;Symphonie Fantastique,&rdquo;
and wrote its sequel, &ldquo;Lelio,&rdquo; a lyrical monologue, in
which he aimed to express the memories of his passion for
the beautiful Miss Smithson. These two parts comprised
what Berlioz named &ldquo;An Episode in the Life of an Artist.&rdquo;
Our composer managed to get the last six months of his
Italian exile remitted, and his return to Paris was hastened
by one of those furious paroxysms of rage to which such
ill-regulated minds are subject. He had adored Miss
Smithson as a celestial divinity, a lovely ideal of art and
beauty, but this had not prevented him from basking in the
rays of the earthly Venus. Before leaving Paris he had
had an intrigue with a certain Mdlle. M&mdash;&mdash;, a somewhat
frivolous and unscrupulous beauty, who had bled his not
overfilled purse with the avidity of a leech. Berlioz heard
just before returning to Paris that the coquette was about
to marry, a conclusion one would fancy which would have
rejoiced his mind. But, no! he was worked to a dreadful
rage by what he considered such perfidy! His one thought
was to avenge himself. He provided himself with three
loaded pistols&mdash;one for the faithless one, one for his rival,
and one for himself&mdash;and was so impatient to start that he
could not wait for passports. He attempted to cross the
frontier in women&rsquo;s clothes, and was arrested. A variety
of <i>contretemps</i> occurred before he got to Paris, and by that
time his rage had so cooled, his sense of the absurdity of
the whole thing grown so keen, that he was rather willing
to send Mdlle. M&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;his blessing than his curse.</p>

<p>About the time of Berlioz&rsquo;s arrival, Miss Smithson also
returned to Paris after a long absence, with the intent of
undertaking the management of an English theatre. It
was a necessity of our composer&rsquo;s nature to be in love, and
the flames of his ardour, fed with fresh fuel, blazed up again
from their old ashes. Berlioz gave a concert, in which his
&ldquo;Episode in the Life of an Artist&rdquo; was interpreted in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>321]</a></span>
connection with the recitations of the text. The explanations
of &ldquo;Lelio&rdquo; so unmistakably pointed to the feeling of
the composer for herself, that Miss Smithson, who by
chance was present, could not be deceived, though she
never yet had seen Berlioz. A few days afterwards a
benefit concert was arranged, in which Miss Smithson&rsquo;s
troupe was to take part, as well as Berlioz, who was to
direct a symphony of his own composition. At the
rehearsal the looks of Berlioz followed Miss Smithson
with such an intent stare, that she said to some one,
&ldquo;Who is that man whose eyes bode me no good?&rdquo; This
was the first occasion of their personal meeting, and it may
be fancied that Berlioz followed up the introduction with
his accustomed vehemence and pertinacity, though without
immediate effect, for Miss Smithson was more inclined to
fear than to love him.</p>

<p>The young directress soon found out that the rage for
Shakespeare, which had swept the public mind under the
influence of the romanticism led by Victor Hugo, Dumas,
Th&eacute;ophile Gautier, Balzac, and others, was spurious. The
wave had been frothing but shallow, and it ebbed away,
leaving the English actress and her enterprise gasping for
life. With no deeper tap-root than the Gallic love of
novelty and the infectious enthusiasm of a few men of
great genius, the Shakespearean mania had a short life,
and Frenchmen shrugged their shoulders over their own
folly, in temporarily preferring the English barbarian to
Racine, Corneille, and Moli&egrave;re. The letters of Berlioz, in
which he scourges the fickleness of his countrymen in
returning again to their &ldquo;false gods,&rdquo; are masterpieces of
pointed invective.</p>

<p>Miss Smithson was speedily involved in great pecuniary
difficulty, and, to add to her misfortunes, she fell down
stairs and broke her leg, thus precluding her own appearance
on the stage. Affairs were in this desperate condition,
when Berlioz came to the fore with a delicate and manly
chivalry worthy of the highest praise. He offered to pay
Miss Smithson&rsquo;s debts, though a poor man himself, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>322]</a></span>
marry her without delay. The ceremony took place
immediately, and thus commenced a connection which
hampered and retarded Berlioz&rsquo;s career, as well as caused
him no little personal unhappiness. He speedily discovered
that his wife was a woman of fretful, imperious temper,
jealous of mere shadows (though Berlioz was a man to give
her substantial cause), and totally lacking in sympathy with
his high-art ideals. When Mdme. Berlioz recovered, it was
to find herself unable longer to act, as her leg was stiff and
her movements unsuited to the exigencies of the stage.
Poor Berlioz was crushed by the weight of the obligations
he had assumed, and, as the years went on, the peevish
plaints of an invalid wife, who had lost her beauty and
power of charming, withered the affection which had once
been so fervid and passionate. Berlioz finally separated
from his once beautiful and worshipped Harriet Smithson,
but to the very last supplied her wants as fully as he could
out of the meagre earnings of his literary work and of
musical compositions, which the Paris public, for the most
part, did not care to listen to. For his son, Louis, the only
offspring of this union, Berlioz felt a devoted affection, and
his loss at sea in after-years was a blow that nearly broke
his heart.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Owing to the unrelenting hostility of Cherubini, Berlioz
failed to secure a professorship at the Conservatoire, a
place to which he was nobly entitled, and was fain to take
up with the position of librarian instead. The paltry wage
he eked out by journalistic writing, for the most part as
musical critic of the <i>Journal des D&eacute;bats</i>, by occasional
concerts, revising proofs, in a word anything which a
versatile and desperate Bohemian could turn his hand to.
In fact, for many years the main subsistence of Berlioz was
derived from feuilleton-writing and the labours of a critic.
His prose is so witty, brilliant, fresh, and epigrammatic,
that he would have been known to posterity as a clever
<i>litt&eacute;rateur</i>, had he not preferred to remain merely a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>323]</a></span>
musician. Dramatic, picturesque, and subtile, with an
admirable sense of art-form, he could have become a
powerful dramatist, perhaps a great novelist. But his soul,
all whose aspirations set towards one goal, revolted from
the labours of literature, still more from the daily grind of
journalistic drudgery. In that remarkable book, <i>M&eacute;moires
de Hector Berlioz</i>, he has made known his misery, and
thus recounts one of his experiences:&mdash;&ldquo;I stood at the
window gazing into the gardens, at the heights of Montmartre,
at the setting sun; reverie bore me a thousand
leagues from my accursed comic opera. And when, on
turning, my eyes fell upon the accursed title at the head
of the accursed sheet, blank still, and obstinately awaiting
my word, despair seized upon me. My guitar rested against
the table; with a kick I crushed its side. Two pistols on
the mantel stared at me with great round eyes. I regarded
them for some time, then beat my forehead with clinched
hand. At last I wept furiously, like a school-boy unable
to do his theme. The bitter tears were a relief. I turned
the pistols towards the wall; I pitied my innocent guitar,
and sought a few chords, which were given without resentment.
Just then my son of six years knocked at the
door [the little Louis whose death, years after, was the
last bitter drop in the composer&rsquo;s cup of life]; owing to
my ill-humour, I had unjustly scolded him that morning.
&lsquo;Papa,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;wilt thou be friends?&rsquo; &lsquo;I <em>will</em> be
friends; come on, my boy;&rsquo; and I ran to open the door.
I took him on my knee, and, with his blonde head on my
breast, we slept together.... Fifteen years since then,
and my torment still endures. Oh, to be always there!&mdash;scores
to write, orchestras to lead, rehearsals to direct.
Let me stand all day with <i>b&acirc;ton</i> in hand, training a chorus,
singing their parts myself, and beating the measure until I
spit blood, and cramp seizes my arm; let me carry desks,
double basses, harps, remove platforms, nail planks like a
porter or a carpenter, and then spend the night in
rectifying the errors of engravers or copyists. I have done,
do, and will do it. That belongs to my musical life, and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>324]</a></span>
bear it without thinking of it, as the hunter bears the
thousand fatigues of the chase. But to scribble eternally
for a livelihood&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It may be fancied that such a man as Berlioz did not
spare the lash, once he gripped the whip-handle, and,
though no man was more generous than he in recognising
and encouraging genuine merit, there was none more
relentless in scourging incompetency, pretentious commonplace,
and the blind conservatism which rests all its faith
in what has been. Our composer made more than one
powerful enemy by this recklessness in telling the truth,
where a more politic man would have gained friends strong
to help in time of need. But Berlioz was too bitter and
reckless, as well as too proud, to debate consequences.</p>

<p>In 1838 Berlioz completed his &ldquo;Benvenuto Cellini,&rdquo; his
only attempt at opera since &ldquo;Les Francs Juges,&rdquo; and,
wonderful to say, managed to get it done at the opera,
though the director, Duponchel, laughed at him as a
lunatic, and the whole company already regarded the work
as damned in advance. The result was a most disastrous
and <i>&eacute;clatant</i> failure, and it would have crushed any man
whose moral backbone was not forged of thrice-tempered
steel. With all these back-sets Hector Berlioz was not
without encouragement. The brilliant Franz Liszt, one of
the musical idols of the age, had bowed before him and
called him master, the great musical protagonist. Spontini,
one of the most successful composers of the time, held him
in affectionate admiration, and always bade him be of good
cheer. Paganini, the greatest of violinists, had hailed him
as equal to Beethoven.</p>

<p>On the night of the failure of &ldquo;Benvenuto Cellini,&rdquo; a
strange-looking man with dishevelled black hair and eyes of
piercing brilliancy had forced his way around into the
green-room, and, seeking out Berlioz, had fallen on his
knees before him and kissed his hand passionately. Then
he threw his arms around him and hailed the astonished
composer as the master-spirit of the age in terms of
glowing eulogium. The next morning, while Berlioz was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>325]</a></span>
in bed, there was a tap at the door, and Paganini&rsquo;s son,
Achille, entered with a note, saying his father was sick,
or he would have come to pay his respects in person. On
opening the note Berlioz found a most complimentary
letter, and a more substantial evidence of admiration, a
check on Baron Rothschild for twenty thousand francs!
Paganini also gave Berlioz a commission to write a concerto
for his Stradivarius viola, which resulted in a grand
symphony, &ldquo;Harold en Italie,&rdquo; founded on Byron&rsquo;s &ldquo;Childe
Harold,&rdquo; but still more an inspiration of his own Italian
adventures, which had had a strong flavour of personal if
they lacked artistic interest.</p>

<p>The generous gift of Paganini raised Berlioz from the
slough of necessity so far that he could give his whole time
to music. Instantly he set about his &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo;
symphony, which will always remain one of his masterpieces&mdash;a
beautifully chiselled work, from the hands of one
inspired by gratitude, unfettered imagination, and the sense
of blessed repose. Our composer&rsquo;s first musical journey was
an extensive tour in Germany in 1841, of which he gives
charming memorials in his letters to Liszt, Heine, Ernst,
and others. His reception was as generous and sympathetic
as it had been cold and scornful in France. Everywhere
he was honoured and praised as one of the great men
of the age. Mendelssohn exchanged <i>b&acirc;tons</i> with him at
Leipsic, notwithstanding the former only half understood
this stalwart Berserker of music. Spohr called him one of
the greatest artists living, though his own direct antithesis,
and Schumann wrote glowingly in the <i>Neue Zeitschrift</i>&mdash;&ldquo;For
myself, Berlioz is as clear as the blue sky above.
I really think there is a new time in music coming.&rdquo;
Berlioz wrote joyfully to Heine&mdash;&ldquo;I came to Germany as
the men of ancient Greece went to the oracle at Delphi,
and the response has been in the highest degree encouraging.&rdquo;
But his Germanic laurels did him no good in France.
The Parisians would have none of him except as a writer of
<i>feuilletons</i>, who pleased them by the vigour with which he
handled the knout, and tickled the levity of the million,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>326]</a></span>
who laughed while they saw the half-dozen or more victims
flayed by merciless satire. Berlioz wept tears of blood
because he had to do such executioner&rsquo;s work, but did it
none the less vigorously for all that.</p>

<p>The composer made another musical journey in Austria
and Hungary in 1844-45, where he was again received
with the most enthusiastic praise and pleasure. It was in
Hungary, especially, that the warmth of his audiences overran
all bounds. One night, at Pesth, where he played the
&ldquo;Rackoczy Indul&eacute;,&rdquo; an orchestral setting of the martial
hymn of the Magyar race, the people were worked into a
positive frenzy, and they would have flung themselves
before him that he might walk over their prostrate bodies.
Vienna, Pesth, and Prague led the way, and the other
cities followed in the wake of an enthusiasm which has
been accorded to not many artists. The French heard
these stories with amazement, for they could not understand
how this musical demigod could be the same as he who was
little better than a witty buffoon. During this absence
Berlioz wrote the greater portion of his &ldquo;Damnation de
Faust,&rdquo; and, as he had made some money, he obeyed the
strong instinct which always ruled him, the hope of winning
the suffrages of his own countrymen.</p>

<p>An eminent French critic claims that this great work, of
which we shall speak further on, contains that which
Gounod&rsquo;s &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; lacks&mdash;insight into the spiritual significance
of Goethe&rsquo;s drama. Berlioz exhausted all his
resources in producing it at the Op&eacute;ra Comique in 1846,
but again he was disappointed by its falling still-born on the
public interest. Berlioz was utterly ruined, and he fled
from France in the dead of winter as from a pestilence.</p>

<p>The genius of this great man was recognised in Holland,
Russia, Austria, and Germany, but among his own countrymen,
for the most part, his name was a laughing-stock and
a bye-word. He offended the pedants and the formalists by
his daring originality, he had secured the hate of rival
musicians by the vigour and keenness of his criticisms.
Berlioz was in the very heat of the artistic controversy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>327]</a></span>
between the classicists and romanticists, and was associated
with Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, Delacroix, Liszt,
Chopin, and others, in fighting that acrimonious art-battle.
While he did not stand formally with the ranks, he yet
secured a still more bitter portion of hostility from their
powerful opponents, for, to opposition in principle, Berlioz
united a caustic and vigorous mode of expression. His
name was a target for the wits. &ldquo;A physician who plays
on the guitar and fancies himself a composer,&rdquo; was the scoff
of malignant gossips. The journals poured on him a flood
of abuse without stint. French malignity is the most
venomous and unscrupulous in the world, and Berlioz was
selected as a choice victim for its most vigorous exercise,
none the less willingly that he had shown so much skill and
zest in impaling the victims of his own artistic and personal
dislike.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>To continue the record of Berlioz&rsquo;s life in consecutive
narrative would be without significance, for it contains but
little for many years except the same indomitable battle
against circumstance and enmity, never yielding an inch,
and always keeping his eyes bent on his own lofty ideal.
In all of art history is there no more masterful heroic
struggle than Berlioz waged for thirty-five years, firm in
his belief that some time, if not during his own life, his
principles would be triumphant, and his name ranked
among the immortals. But what of the meanwhile? This
problem Berlioz solved, in his later as in earlier years, by
doing the distasteful work of the literary scrub. But never
did he cease composing; though no one would then have
his works, his clear eye perceived the coming time when his
genius would not be denied, when an apotheosis should
comfort his spirit wandering in Hades.</p>

<p>Among Berlioz&rsquo;s later works was an opera of which he
had composed both words and music, consisting of two
parts, &ldquo;The Taking of Troy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Trojans at
Carthage,&rdquo; the latter of which at last secured a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>328]</a></span>
representations at a minor theatre in 1863. The plan of
this work required that it should be carried out under the
most perfect conditions. &ldquo;In order,&rdquo; says Berlioz, &ldquo;to
properly produce such a work as &lsquo;Les Trojans,&rsquo; I must be
absolute master of the theatre, as of the orchestra in
directing a symphony. I must have the good-will of all,
be obeyed by all, from prima-donna to scene-shifter. A
lyrical theatre, as I conceive it, is a great instrument of
music, which, if I am to play, must be placed unreservedly
in my hands.&rdquo; Wagner found a King of Bavaria to help
him carry out a similar colossal scheme at Bayreuth, but ill
luck followed a man no less great through life. His grand
&ldquo;Trojans&rdquo; was mutilated, tinkered, patched, and belittled,
to suit the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Lyrique. It was a butchery of the
work, but still it yielded the composer enough to justify his
retirement from the <i>Journal des D&eacute;bats</i>, after thirty years
of slavery.</p>

<p>Berlioz was now sixty years old, a lonely man, frail in
body, embittered in soul by the terrible sense of failure.
His wife, with whom he had lived on terms of alienation,
was dead; his only son far away, cruising on a man-of-war.
His courage and ambition were gone. To one who
remarked that his music belonged to the future, he replied
that he doubted if it ever belonged to the past. His life
seemed to have been a mistake, so utterly had he failed to
impress himself on the public. Yet there were times when
audiences felt themselves moved by the power of his music
out of the ruts of preconceived opinion into a prophecy of
his coming greatness. There is an interesting anecdote
told by a French writer:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some years ago M. Pasdeloup gave the <i>septuor</i> from
the &lsquo;Trojans&rsquo; at a benefit concert. The best places were
occupied by the people of the world, but the <i>&eacute;lite intelligente</i>
were ranged upon the highest seats of the Cirque. The
programme was superb, and those who were there neither
for Fashion&rsquo;s nor Charity&rsquo;s sake, but for love of what
was best in art, were enthusiastic in view of all those
masterpieces. The worthless overture of the &lsquo;Proph&egrave;te,&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>329]</a></span>
disfiguring this fine <i>ensemble</i>, had been hissed by some
students of the Conservatoire, and, accustomed as I was to
the blindness of the general public, knowing its implacable
prejudices, I trembled for the fate of the magnificent
<i>septuor</i> about to follow. My fears were strangely ill-founded;
no sooner had ceased this hymn of infinite love
and peace, than these same students, and the whole
assemblage with them, burst into such a tempest of applause
as I never heard before. Berlioz was hidden in the
further ranks, and, the instant he was discovered, the
work was forgotten for the man; his name flew from
mouth to mouth, and four thousand people were standing
upright, with their arms stretched towards him. Chance had
placed me near him, and never shall I forget the scene.
That name, apparently ignored by the crowd, it had
learned all at once, and was repeating as that of one of its
heroes. Overcome as by the strongest emotion of his life,
his head upon his breast, he listened to this tumultuous cry
of &lsquo;Vive Berlioz!&rsquo; and when, on looking up, he saw all eyes
upon him and all arms extended towards him, he could not
withstand the sight; he trembled, tried to smile, and broke
into sobbing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Berlioz&rsquo;s supremacy in the field of orchestral composition,
his knowledge of technique, his novel combination, his
insight into the resources of instruments, his skill in
grouping, his rich sense of colour, are incontestably without
a parallel, except by Beethoven and Wagner. He
describes his own method of study as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I carried with me to the opera the score of whatever
work was on the bill, and read during the performance.
In this way I began to familiarise myself with orchestral
methods, and to learn the voice and quality of the various
instruments, if not their range and mechanism. By this
attentive comparison of the effect with the means employed
to produce it, I found the hidden link uniting musical
expression to the special art of instrumentation. The study
of Beethoven, Weber, and Spontini, the impartial examination
both of the <em>customs</em> of orchestration and of <em>unusual</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>330]</a></span>
forms and combinations, the visits I made to <i>virtuosi</i>, the
trials I led them to make upon their respective instruments,
and a little instinct, did for me the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The principal symphonies of Berlioz are works of colossal
character and richness of treatment, some of them requiring
several orchestras. Contrasting with these are such
marvels of delicacy as &ldquo;Queen Mab,&rdquo; of which it has been
said that the &ldquo;confessions of roses and the complaints of
violets were noisy in comparison.&rdquo; A man of magnificent
genius and knowledge, he was but little understood during
his life, and it was only when his uneasy spirit was at rest
that the world recognised his greatness. Paris, that stoned
him when he was living, now listens to his grand music
with enthusiasm. Hector Berlioz to the last never lost
faith in himself, though this man of genius, in his much
suffering from depression and melancholy, gave good
witness to the truth of Goethe&rsquo;s lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Who never ate with tears his bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor, weeping through the night&rsquo;s long hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay restlessly tossing on his bed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He knows ye not, ye heavenly Powers.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A man utterly without reticence, who, Gallic fashion,
would shout his wrongs and sufferings to the uttermost
ends of the earth, yet without a smack of Gallic posing and
affectation, Berlioz talks much about himself, and dares to
estimate himself boldly. There was no small vanity about
this colossal spirit. He speaks of himself with outspoken
frankness, as he would discuss another. We cannot do
better than to quote one of these self-measurements:&mdash;&ldquo;My
style is in general very daring, but it has not the slightest
tendency to destroy any of the constructive elements of art.
On the contrary, I seek to increase the number of these
elements. I have never dreamed, as has foolishly been
supposed in France, of writing music without melody.
That school exists to-day in Germany, and I have a horror
of it. It is easy for any one to convince himself that, without
confining myself to taking a very short melody for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>331]</a></span>
a theme, as the very greatest masters have, I have always
taken care to invest my compositions with a real wealth of
melody. The value of these melodies, their distinction,
their novelty, and charm, can be very well contested; it is
not for me to appraise them. But to deny their existence
is either bad faith or stupidity; only as these melodies are
often of very large dimensions, infantile and short-sighted
minds do not clearly distinguish their form; or else they
are wedded to other secondary melodies which veil their
outlines from those same infantile minds; or, upon the
whole, these melodies are so dissimilar to the little
waggeries that the musical <i>plebs</i> call melodies that they
cannot make up their minds to give the same name to
both. The dominant qualities of my music are passionate
expression, internal fire, rhythmic animation, and
unexpected changes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Heinrich Heine, the German poet, who was Berlioz&rsquo;s
friend, called him a &ldquo;colossal nightingale, a lark of eagle-size,
such as they tell us existed in the primeval world.&rdquo;
The poet goes on to say&mdash;&ldquo;Berlioz&rsquo;s music, in general,
has in it something primeval if not antediluvian to my
mind; it makes me think of gigantic species of extinct
animals, of fabulous empires full of fabulous sins, of heaped-up
impossibilities; his magical accents call to our minds
Babylon, the hanging gardens, the wonders of Nineveh, the
daring edifices of Mizraim, as we see them in the pictures
of the Englishman Martin.&rdquo; Shortly after the publication
of &ldquo;Lutetia,&rdquo; in which this bold characterisation was
expressed, the first performance of Berlioz&rsquo;s &ldquo;Enfance du
Christ&rdquo; was given, and the poet, who was on his sick-bed,
wrote a penitential letter to his friend for not having given
him justice. &ldquo;I hear on all sides,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that you
have just plucked a nosegay of the sweetest melodious
flowers, and that your oratorio is throughout a masterpiece
of <i>na&iuml;vet&egrave;</i>. I shall never forgive myself for having been so
unjust to a friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Berlioz died at the age of sixty-five. His funeral
services were held at the Church of the Trinity, a few days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>332]</a></span>
after those of Rossini. The discourse at the grave was
pronounced by Gounod, and many eloquent things were
said of him, among them a quotation of the epitaph of
Marshal Trivulce, &ldquo;<i>Hic tandem quiescit qui nunquam
quievit</i>&rdquo; (Here he is quiet, at last, who never was quiet
before). Soon after his death appeared his <i>M&eacute;moires</i>,
and his bones had hardly got cold when the performance
of his music at the Conservatoire, the Cirque, and
the Chatelet began to be heard with the most hearty
enthusiasm.</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Th&eacute;ophile Gautier says that no one will deny to Berlioz
a great character, though, the world being given to controversies,
it may be argued whether or not he was a great
genius. The world of to-day has but one opinion on both
these questions. The force of Berlioz&rsquo;s character was
phenomenal. His vitality was so passionate and active
that brain and nerve quivered with it, and made him reach
out towards experience at every facet of his nature.
Quietude was torture, rest a sin, for this daring temperament.
His eager and subtile intelligence pierced every
sham, and his imagination knew no bounds to its sweep,
oftentimes even disdaining the bounds of art in its audacity
and impatience. This big, virile nature, thwarted and
embittered by opposition, became hardened into violent
self-assertion; this naturally resolute will settled back into
fierce obstinacy; this fine nature, sensitive and sincere, got
torn and ragged with passion under the stress of his unfortunate
life. But, at one breath of true sympathy how
quickly the nobility of the man asserted itself! All his
cynicism and hatred melted away, and left only sweetness,
truth, and genial kindness.</p>

<p>When Berlioz entered on his studies, he had reached an
age at which Mozart, Schubert, Mendelssohn, Rossini, and
others, had already done some of the best work of their
lives. Yet it took only a few years to achieve a development
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>333]</a></span>
that produced such a great work as the &ldquo;Symphonie
Fantastique,&rdquo; the prototype of modern programme music.</p>

<p>From first to last it was the ambition of Berlioz to widen
the domain of his art. He strove to attain a more intimate
connection between instrumental music and poetry in the
portrayal of intense passions, and the suggestion of well-defined
dramatic situations. In spite of the fact that he
frequently overshot his mark, it does not make his works
one whit less astonishing. An uncompromising champion
of what has been dubbed &ldquo;programme&rdquo; music, he thought
it legitimate to force the imagination of the hearer to dwell
on exterior scenes during the progress of the music, and to
distress the mind in its attempt to find an exact relation
between the text and the music. The most perfect specimens
of the works of Berlioz, however, are those in which the
music speaks for itself, such as the &ldquo;Sc&egrave;ne aux Champs,&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Marche au Supplice,&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Symphonie Fantastique,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Marche des P&egrave;lerins,&rdquo; in &ldquo;Harold;&rdquo; the
overtures to &ldquo;King Lear,&rdquo; &ldquo;Benvenuto Cellini,&rdquo; &ldquo;Carnaval
Romain,&rdquo; &ldquo;Le Corsaire,&rdquo; &ldquo;Les Francs Juges,&rdquo; etc.</p>

<p>As a master of the orchestra, no one has been the equal
of Berlioz in the whole history of music, not even Beethoven
or Wagner. He treats the orchestra with the absolute
daring and mastery exercised by Paganini over the violin,
and by Liszt over the piano. No one has showed so deep
an insight into the individuality of each instrument, its
resources, the extent to which its capabilities could be
carried. Between the phrase and the instrument, or group
of instruments, the equality is perfect; and independent of
this power, made up equally of instinct and knowledge,
this composer shows a sense of orchestral colour in combining
single instruments so as to form groups, or in the combination
of several separate groups of instruments by which he
has produced the most novel and beautiful effects&mdash;effects
not found in other composers. The originality and variety
of his rhythms, the perfection of his instrumentation, have
never been disputed even by his opponents. In many of
his works, especially those of a religious character, there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>334]</a></span>
a Cyclopean bigness of instrumental means used, entirely
beyond parallel in art. Like the Titans of old, he would
scale the very heavens in his daring. In one of his works
he does not hesitate to use three orchestras, three choruses
(all of full dimensions), four organs, and a triple quartet.
The conceptions of Berlioz were so grandiose that he sometimes
disdained detail, and the result was that more than
one of his compositions have rugged grandeur at the expense
of symmetry and balance of form.</p>

<p>Yet, when he chose, Berlioz could write the most exquisite
and dainty lyrics possible. What could be more exquisitely
tender than many of his songs and romances, and various
of the airs and choral pieces from &ldquo;Beatrice et Benedict,&rdquo;
from &ldquo;Nuits d&rsquo;&Eacute;t&eacute;,&rdquo; &ldquo;Irlande,&rdquo; and from &ldquo;L&rsquo;Enfance du
Christ?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Berlioz in his entirety, as man and composer, was a most
extraordinary being, to whom the ordinary scale of measure
can hardly be applied. Though he founded no new school,
he pushed to a fuller development the possibilities to which
Beethoven reached out in the Ninth Symphony. He was
the great <i>virtuoso</i> on the orchestra, and on this Briarean
instrument he played with the most amazing skill. Others
have surpassed him in the richness of the musical substance
out of which their tone-pictures are woven, in symmetry of
form, in finish of detail; but no one has ever equalled him
in that absolute mastery over instruments, by which a
hundred become as plastic and flexible as one, and are
made to embody every phase of the composer&rsquo;s thought
with that warmth of colour and precision of form long
believed to be necessarily confined to the sister arts.</p>

THE HEATHER ON FIRE.</p>

<p class="center lrgfont smcap">By MATHILDE BLIND. Price 1s.</p>


<p>&ldquo;A subject of our own time fertile in what is pathetic and awe-inspiring, and free
from any taint of the vulgar and conventional.... Positive subject-matter, the
emotion which inheres in actual life, the very smile and the very tear and heart-pang,
are, after all, precious to poetry, and we have them here. &lsquo;The Heather on Fire&rsquo; may
possibly prove something of a new departure, and one that was certainly not superfluous....
Even apart from the fascination of its subject-matter, the poem is developed
with spirit and energy, with a feeling for homely truth of character and treatment,
and with a generally pervasive sense of beauty.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Blind has chosen for her new poem one of those terrible Highland clearances
which stain the history of Scotch landlordism. Though her tale is a fiction, it is too
well founded on fact.... It may be said generally of the poem that the most difficult
scenes are those in which Miss Blind succeeds best; and on the whole we are inclined
to think that its greatest and most surprising success is the picture of the poor old
soldier, Rory, driven mad by the burning of his wife.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Academy.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;A subject which has painfully pre-occupied public opinion is, in the poem entitled
&lsquo;The Heather on Fire,&rsquo; treated with characteristic power by Miss Blind.... Both as
a narrative and descriptive poem, &lsquo;The Heather on Fire&rsquo; is equally remarkable.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Morning
Post.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;A poem remarkable for beauty of expression and pathos of incidents will be found
in &lsquo;The Heather on Fire.&rsquo; Exquisitely delicate are the touches with which the progress
of this tale of true love is delineated up to its consummation amid the simple rejoicings of
the neighbourhood; and the flight of years of married life and daily toil, as numerous
as those of their courtship, is told in stanzas full of music and soul.... This tale
is one which, unless we are mistaken, may so affect public feeling as to be an effectual
bar to similar human clearings in future.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Leeds Mercury.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Literature and poetry are never seen at their best save in contact with actual life.
This little book abounds in vivid delineation of character, and is redolent with the
noblest human sympathy.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Newcastle Daily Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Heather on Fire&rsquo; is a poem that is rich not only in power and beauty but
in that &lsquo;enthusiasm of humanity&rsquo; which stirs and moves us, and of which so much
contemporary verse is almost painfully deficient.... Miss Blind is not a mere poetic
trifler who considers that the best poetry is that written by the man who has nothing
to say but can say that nothing gracefully.... We can best describe the kind of her
success by noting the fact that while engaged in the perusal of her book we do not
say, &lsquo;What a fine poem!&rsquo; but &lsquo;What a terrible story!&rsquo; or more probably still say
nothing at all but read on and on under the spell of a great horror and an overpowering
pity. Poetry of which this can be said needs no other recommendation.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The
Manchester Examiner and Times.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;A poem recently published in London (&lsquo;The Heather on Fire; a Tale of the Highland
Clearances&rsquo;) is declared, in one of the articles which have appeared in the German
press on the Scottish Land Question, &lsquo;to be based on terrible truth and undoubted real
horrors; giving, in noblest poetical language and thrilling words, a description which
ought to be a spur of action to thinking statesmen.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;<i>North British Daily Mail.</i></p>
